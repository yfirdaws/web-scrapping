It also did have a big impact on me because I consider myself a No man like I am good staying at my home more often than going out with my friends. 

Not like I am going to say Yes to everything now but the idea of being open to opportunities, fun feels pretty good."
2,Jojo Rabbit,505,j9qshe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/j9qshe/jojo_rabbit/,49,1602537780.0,"Has probably been posted a million times already.

Incredible art style and visuals (like Into the Spiderverse in many ways), great voice acting. It‚Äôs funny and heartfelt, low stakes and the perfect film to watch with family.

It's about two girls who tried so hard during high school that they never went out. On the night of graduation, they decide to try and cram four years of partying into one night. One of the most genuinely funny movies I've seen in a long time and one of those movies you can watch over and over again. Please give it a shot!

Edit: Was NOT expecting this to be so controversial hahaha! Well, guess you'll either love it or hate it, but if you have Hulu might as well try it out!"
5,Can someone suggest me a film like this? Should be easy.,368,cpdn9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/cpdn9p/can_someone_suggest_me_a_film_like_this_should_be/,100,1565651388.0,"I need a film which is set in 1948 with a man aged 36 as the protagonist. The length has to be at least 2 hours long but longer than 3 hours.

It needs at least 5 car racing scenes but at least 3 of them have to end in the ‚Äòchaser‚Äô catching the guy.

It needs to be a very funny film but also a very sad film. I need lots of violence.

It HAS to include a attractive woman aged 26 who the protagonist falls in love with but she doesn‚Äôt love him well she thinks she doesn‚Äôt until he saves her life then she falls for him.

It has to have a very deep meaning with lots of hidden symbolism.

The cinematography has to be unique.

Ok thanks reddit it should be very easy, good luck!"

It‚Äôs got a very interesting premise and because of that, it benefits from multiple viewings. It‚Äôs a whodunit, but the modernization of it makes it interesting. It‚Äôs funny as well, with fantastic acting from an ensemble cast.

I wouldn‚Äôt call it a perfect movie, as I have some slight issues with the script but other than that, it‚Äôs really well done and goes by fast."

11,An awfully good journey with Daniel Radcliffe - Swiss Army Man,236,knj4zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/knj4zk/an_awfully_good_journey_with_daniel_radcliffe/,33,1609418772.0,"In my opinion, really close to a masterpiece but not quite stands the Swiss Army Man (2016). First question you will ask, is it stupid?, and my answer is - hell yeah! It's a really fucking stupid movie with quite stupid jokes, yet the best part of it is how it ties the dumb but hilarious humor with some really serious topics. The movie is starring Daniel Radcliffe as a dead body, which can talk, use its genitals as a compass and move on the water by farting. At the start the movie seems childish, stupid and gross, but it does get pretty funny at some point. The movie actually revolves around some dark stuff like suicide and insanity, has quite an interesting and sometimes wholesome story and some awesome soundtrack to top it off. At the end, it raises some serious questions in the viewers head, and that is exactly why my love for this movie is so big. Yes, the movie is quite stupid, but it's hella fun to watch! And also Daniel Radcliffe was great at playing a dead body. Best performance I've seen from him so far. So I recommend all of you to try it out. Really, worth watching."

With a run time of 1:37, it was low risk investment of my time. The trailer will essentially lay out the entire story. The director does a good job maintaining a consistent tone throughout,  funny and heartwarming while lacking cynicism and pretentiousness. If you like Paul Rudd, I think you will like this film. An excellent performance by Craig Roberts and a decent enough turn by Selena Gomez to be enjoyable. My teenage daughter came in near the end and, per her request, we watched it together a couple of nights later. We added a word to our shorthand vernacular, ""mall"". üòÇ 

It is rated TV-MA. No sex, no violence, some language and some frank sexual talk (in a humorous way)."

Massively underrated. This made me laugh out loud and cry profusely. It takes a special movie to evoke that kind of a reaction out of you. It's a feel-good but also give you chills kind of a movie.

We're looking for more fun, lighthearted comedies. Basically, something easy to watch. HFTWP was so whimsical, cute, FUNNY, and easy to watch/enjoy. We've already seen the rest of Waititi's work and liked it a lot, especially Thor: Ragnarok! Can anyone recommend us some more movies like this?"

I don't want to give too much away, but this movie has so much going for it. The characters are great, as is the action. It's both funny and heartfelt. An amazing movie about a diverse range of Christmas experience, class divides, and how dignity and family should be enjoyed by all. Japanese anime master Satoshi Kon comes through again. But seriously, I can't recommend this one enough."

The movie is about two fallen Angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) that want to go back to heaven, but this will have concequenses. So a 'random' woman(Linda Fiorentino) is chosen by God to stop them. I found it pretty amazing and very funny. Most of the jokes are stupid but that's what makes it funny. The script is very original and on of a kind. 

One thing that I didn't like  is Kevin Smith's character (Silent Bob) who doesn't speak at all. He has to do everything with body acting and it's not that easy. 

I highly recommend this. Its funny and original. A great way to spend 2 hours!"

I think it is a great, light-hearted film, that takes place in space. It has good alien designs, funny jokes, a good plot, entertaining actors, and some deeper moments that are handled well. I haven't done acid all too much, but I imagine this movie would be great if you were tripping. But, acid or no acid this movie is a blast, I recommend checking it out."

Is it the most racist movie all time? Maybe. Is it good? Yes. This movie deals with a special forces american team that tries to stop a terrorist attack that will end the world as we know it. The writers ( they are the writers of south park) had quite big balls to write a movie like this four years after the tragic events of 9/11. Still it's a very funny movie because it's a satire of all the action movies and it's a more Michael Bay movie than you could possibly imagine. You can see it from the opening sequence. The destroy the entire Paris but they are happy because a bomb didn't explode. Also the direction of this film is amazing and out of the box, because all the characters are muppets.

Again if you get offended with racist jokes don't watch it. However if you have one and a half hours and you don't know what to do go ahead and watch it."

What I loved about this is it's a >!true story with a good ending!<. The characters were great. Babs was the ""prodigy"", he was smarter than the average skinhead, that is why he chose to ""drop the patch."" Pa was terrifying - he controlled everyone and everyone loved him.

My favorite character is Ma. Manipulative but truly cares for Babs.

The offbeat string soundtrack added dread early on. It has a typical ""A24 flavor."" You know that it can't be bad."
35,Are There Any 'Serious' Mermaid Movies Out There?,111,kv667j,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/kv667j/are_there_any_serious_mermaid_movies_out_there/,156,1610411618.0,"The problem is that most movies, where the main topic is *mermaid*, are either Comedy or Family movies. Found a good quote that fits this topic perfectly: ""Mermaid movies only come in one of two flavors. Either super happy girly fun time young audience movies, or bloody horror movies"".

I recently watched Pirates of the Caribbean 4 and enjoyed the story around the mermaids. So I was hoping for a movie where mermaids would be more in the centre of the movie and surfed the internet. 
The variety was really disappointing and like I was saying before, they were either Comedy movies (the story was more or less the same: Some dude finds a mermaid on a beach and gets in lots of 'funny' trouble) or Family movies (Either for really young children (e.g. The Little Mermaid) or for teenagers). I'm not saying that these movies immediately have to be bad, it's just a lack of variety. The most serious movies of them all were Horror movies, which I'm not really a fan of.

So if you know some good movies with mermaids, please recommend me them. They even can be Comedy or Family, if you find them really good."

It has mediocre reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but I think the critics got it wrong and don‚Äôt understand this movie. It‚Äôs about overcoming and working hard, but at the same time just has a lot of fun with it. The old school rock and roll soundtrack fits strangely well. One of my favourite opening scenes is this movies opening credits, with Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You‚Äù playing as people groove and get merry at a jousting tournament. It truly captures the essence of a sporting event, and the whole film follows that same feeling of fun. The comedy is funny, the characters are interesting and well written, the story is simple and relatively predictable but it‚Äôs not about the story. It‚Äôs about having fun. It‚Äôs a movie you can sit down and watch or just have on in the background, and I highly recommend it."

##*Hey there. Like a lot of you in this sub - I love movies. But lately I find myself watching them less and less. Like I want to, but... eh, I can do other things too. I've seen people do challenges like 365 movies a year. I don't think I can pull that off. But I decided to try and watch 1 movie every day in april. And if you're reading this - then I finished my own challenge! (yay) So here I'm sharing with you which films I saw and which ones I would recommend or not. I suck at giving out ratings like out of ten or whatever, so it'll be more like a thumbs up/thumbs down situation, based on ""enjoyment for whatever reason"". Hope you find this useful. The only criteria for films I have is - I either have never seen the movie before, or started watching and didn't finish it for whatever reason. I will elaborate on specific movies if the need arises. I got a huge backlog of movies that I've been meaning to watch, so here we go, let's start at day 1:*

#1. [The Warriors \(1979\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023205_warriors)

Off to a good start. **I recommend this.** I love the way the movie looks more than anything else. I love the night setting, and the hard light contrast. Modern movies are all brightly lit at night (which makes it easier to see, but some of the magic is lost). At times it reminded me of Assault on Precinct 13/Escape from New York, at times it was just any old B movie (bad acting / silly lines and all), but this movie is really bigger than just the sum of it's parts. Can you dig it?
___
#2. [Scott Pilgrim VS The World \(2010\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scott_pilgrims_vs_the_world)

**Recommend.** No surprises here. I consider myself an Edgar Wright fan, but I've seen only 4 of his films (cornetto trilogy and Antman) and Paul which he produced. Loved all of them. Scott Pilgrim was a bit tougher to get into, because I hate teenager/young adult movies, I hate teen romance BS as well, I cringe so hard every time. Unlike his other films - it didn't grab me right away, and for the first half hour of the movie I wanted to turn it off. When the more surreal stuff starts, and the hip teen dialogue is toned down - that's when I really got into it. Not my favorite movie of his (how can you beat Hot Fuzz?) but a great great film overall.
___
#3. [The Mist \(2007\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mist)

I'm gonna go with a **non recommendation** on this one. **Minor spoilers ahead.** I have not yet read the novel, and I probably won't, so the judging is only on the movie. I liked the concept (hence why I decided to watch it) and it was promising at the start - good actors, the setup was going OK. And then when things start actually happening it all fell apart for me. The bad CGI was the first hint of it, the character motivations/actions and the initial conflict seemed stupid. The later conflict seemed even more stupid. Perhaps it is the way I was raised, but religious nutjob argument in dire times has never seemed plausible (or in media - entertaining). The very end would have been interesting if I cared about the characters at all, but I didn't (even the main guy, what was even his name? I just saw the film!). Halfway through I was just waiting for the movie to be over, and if it wasn't for my challenge - I would have given up. Biggest problem with this - it's supposed to be a horror movie. It's not scary, but a lot of these types of films aren't. Let's say Dawn of the Dead - very similar concept. It's about the drama and the interaction of the characters dealing with an outside threat. There's tension and suspence. Here there was only boredom.
___
#4. [Dances With Wolves \(1990\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dances_with_wolves)

I **recommend** this. IF YOU GOT 4 HOURS TO SPEND! I mean, holy balls is this movie long. I don't think it would have worked any other way, but still... I had to watch it in 2 sittings on my day off. I watched for 2 hours in the morning, and now, as I'm typing this - I just finished watching it and it's already past midnight so I didn't finish it on the day I started it. I failed the challenge. But since I'm my own judge - I'm gonna allow it, cause technically it's still today. It will be tomorrow once I go to sleep and wake up. About the movie itself though - I didn't get the same feeling at the end that I got from say Dollars Trilogy or Django Unchained, but then again this is a very different type of western. It's slow and epic. Good night.
___
#5. [Bruno \(2009\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bruno)

I'm going with a **non recommendation** here. This is one of the movies that I've tried watching previously but have given up. Now I finished it. Before this - I've seen Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" and ""Grimsby"" and I loved both. I know that only one of those is an actually good film, you don't have to tell me that. The problem is, unlike Borat - most jokes here seemed mean spirited. And that can be funny (the TV show interview with his baby was so funny I actually peed a little) but a lot of times it wasn't. Also, even though the movies have similar structure - Borat had more of a plot, which I appreciated. I would suggest watching the most popular clips from Bruno on youtube. Those are the good parts.
___
#6. [Collateral \(2004\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/collateral)

A **wholehearted recommendation.** I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's as close to a perfect movie for me as it gets. A simple premise, slow buildup(though short), intense fast moving thriller and it leaves it slightly open for what happened to the characters after the movie ends, so I the viewer can decide. I was pretty much glued to the screen, and the movie is like 2 hours long but it doesn't feel like that at all. If it weren't for a few not subtle lines explaining to the audience what's going on ""hey wasn't there a taxi driver who did a similar thing already? the thing that's going on right now, let me explain to you in detail even though you just saw it happen for yourself?"" then it would have been perfect. But I can forgive the movie, cause it does everything else great. Check it out!
___
#7. [Kung Fu Hustle \(2005\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kung_fu_hustle)

I have seen Shaolin Soccer multiple times, and I love it. It's the same director, so I think it's appropriate to compare the two movies. Kung-Fu Hustle is excellent in it's execution and visual presentation, but that's it... I heard people say how funny it is, and admittedly there are many visual gags, some of which even had me exhale air at slightly higher speeds, but the actual constructed jokes were not that many. The biggest problem is the story and the way it's presented. Almost 2/3 into the movie I had no idea who the main character is supposed to be, it just felt like a huge cast, most of whom appear in different scenes from each other that are very loosely connected. Shaolin Soccer had a much more straightforward narrative. Also the world it was set in was mostly realistic, so the surreal stuff kept things interesting, whereas Kung-fu Hustle is set in surreal ~1950's China(?) so the added surreal kung-fu on top of the surreal world didn't really do much to enhance it (for me anyway). **I would really recommend Shaolin Soccer.**
___
#8. [Prisoners \(2013\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prisoners_2013)

HOLY FUCKING SHITBALLS. **RECOMMED RECOMMED A BILLION TIMES RECOMMEND!** If you can watch only one movie out of the ones I recommended thus far - **watch Prisoners**. I don't want to say anything about the movie itself, because I went in blind, and it is the best way to see it. I was actually very lucky like that, I never heard of the film, I saw a DVD in ‚Ç¨1 bin at a supermarket, the cover had Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal as the art. The cover looked pretty bad TBH, but I love Jake Gyllenhaal and I got nothing bad to say about Hugh Jackman either. This is hands down **THE BEST** I've seen of both of them, (and yes, this includes Nightcrawler). Aside from acting - the best thing I can say about the movie (without spoiling anything) is the use of music, and the use of silence. As soon as I finish typing this - I'm adding all other movies from this director to my eventual ""to watch"" list. Holy fuck, this movie was... intense.

___
#9. [Planes, Trains and Automobiles \(1987\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/planes_trains_and_automobiles/)

Call me heartless but this movie did nothing for me, so I'm going with a **non recommendation**. After Prisoners I wanted something light-hearted and funny. I think I would really enjoy this movie if I saw it maybe 20 years ago, or if during those 20 years I didn't see tens or even hundreds of media things inspired by this movie. From situations to visual gags to character personalities. As it is though - it did nothing. I didn't hate it or anything, and I could see why all of this was supposed to be funny. I just didn't laugh and didn't get any feelings for the characters. Next.

___
#10. [Hidden \(2015\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hidden_2015)

**Do not recommend.** I chose this movie today cause I'm tired, and it had the shortest runtime of the movies I already have on hand - 1h23m, but unfortunately it felt like 5 hours. **Spoilers ahead:** I expected a horror movie. What I got was a family relationship story, like a comedy, set in an unlikely environment, even with uplifting musical undertones. The second half of the film shows why they're ""hidden"". The plot twist was there, but it did nothing to elevate the movie. Last 20-25 minutes were stupid AF. If you wanna watch a good low budget film - the last good one I saw was Cop Car. It's not perfect, but damn how much better it is than Hidden.

___
#11. [Jaws \(1975\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jaws)

Yep, never seen Jaws. I'm way behind on my Steven Spielberg. **Recommend!** Just like Planes, Trains & Automobiles I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if I saw it when I was younger, but I could still appreciate it now also. Overall - nothing that I haven't seen before (because so many movies were inspired by it in so many ways) it was going well, but as soon as they were on the boat, and it's just the 3 characters - the movie became really good. I'm gonna avoid all the sequels though.
___
#12. [Bone Tomahawk \(2015\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bone_tomahawk)

**A lukewarm recommendation.** This movie shows up quite a lot on ""le hidden movie gems"" lists. The first third of it is pretty bad. Production wise - it looked like a cheap TV show, or a made for TV movie from the 1990's. The fact that it's slow moving was a detriment in this case. I was ready to shut it off. Thankfully it gets a lot better once the plot starts happening, and either they use different cameras or in daylight it stopped being so apparent. Overall nothing mindblowing, yet not offensively stupid or bad neither. Middle of the road. You won't gain too much by watching it, but you won't think you wasted your time neither. Or I didn't, at least.

___
#13. [Let the Right One In \(2008\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/let_the_right_one_in)

**Recommend!** Freakin' awesome. Go in blind, if you haven't seen this. All I knew was - it's a swedish film about vampires. That's all I needed to know really. Let the Right One is up there with my favorite vampire movies of all time (Near Dark, From Dusk 'Till Dawn). Everything in this movie is great, from story, to cinematography (beautiful use of static shots) to music to acting. Especially kid actors, they're freakin' amazing. In that they act like actual kids, not like puppets pretending to be someone else. If you wanted but couldn't get back into vampire movies after twilight - check this out!

___
#14. [A Serbian Film \(2011\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_serbian_film)

**Yeah, I'll recommend this.** Not sure to whom, but I'll recommend it. I'll be honest, the only motivation I had for watching was so I could say that I did. ""The most disgusting movie ever"" ""the most fucked up movie ever"". Yeah, could be (I mean, I haven't seen every movie ever to back up that claim, but it's definitely very fucked up). But is it a bad movie? Like the type you should just avoid? No. It looks like a real movie, production wise. Acting was good. The score was obnoxious at times though. That would be my biggest complaint. Although it did hit the mark, spot on, a couple of times as well, so, idk. And the movie almost succeeded in telling a story. I'll explain the ""almost"" in text below, but I definitely recommend this, so do with this information what you will.

**SPOILERS:** in the entirety of the second half my investment in the story was at it's peak. I wanted to see how it ends, and I wanted to see why all this fucked up shit was happening to this seemingly normal guy. Well, the way it ends for the guy was great. I don't think it could have ended any other way, and still be satisfying. But it was never explained why everything that happened - happened. Like if that one director was just clinically insane and super rich to organize all this, who was the bald guy in the very end? Why were they still filming it? (like in the context of the movie) I read the wikipedia explanation of the plot, but it still didn't answer anything. Shit just happened. 

**Do you want to watch this movie? It has a lot of fucked up things. 4 big ones, 3 of which I'm gonna spoil right here:** a woman gives birth and a man immediately after removing the baby from her womb rapes it. A man sticks his penis down a womans throat then pinches her nose until she suffocates on his penis. A man fucks another man in the eye to death. And one more thing I'm omitting cause it's in service of the plot. If you're reading this and you decide to watch the film anyway - you'll probably want to find the last one out for yourself. 

Is it that bad? No. The idea of it - IS, but the depiction, I mean I could tell from a mile away that it was not a real baby. Nor that the woman was choking, I've seen deepthroat porn before. If you saw movies like Antichrist - this will not be something too shocking.

___
#15. [Pumping Iron \(1976\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pumping_iron/)

**Recommend.** A bit of a change of pace - it's a documentary. The movie is in 2 parts. Firstly it follows the preparations to Mr. Universe 1975 contest (amateur bodybuilding world championship or something) and event itself shown mostly from perspective of Mike Cats. And then the preparations to Mr. Olympia 1975 (professional bodybuilding world championship with money prizes and stuff like that or something) from the perspectives of Lou Ferrigno and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The best part of the movie is Arnold, whether he's talking about cumming on stage in front of people, or how he doesn't drink milk - it's very entertaining. He was also one cheeky fucker lemme tell you, I dunno how much of the movie was dramatization and how much was actual documentary footage cause from what I read they all knew each other and were all friends, but Arnie was so cheeky at times he seemed like an asshole. But very entertaining to watch, don't get me wrong! Also, his english pronunciation was so much better back in 1975 than it is now - it's so weird. Don't watch this movie if you're unsure of your sexuality as a man though. You might confirm some dark thoughts you had, cause this whole movie is pretty much just attractive naked men flexing seductively.

___
#16. [Trick 'r Treat \(2007\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trick_r_treat)

**Recommend!** This was great. On a pure enjoyment level - I was entertained all the way through. The movie looks very slick, the acting by everyone involved is great (very good performances by child/teenage actors as well, absolutely no cringe!), the pacing was spot on for the type of movie it is. It's like a series of smaller horror segments happening in one night (on halloween, who would have guessed?) and loosely connected. It's short, and because it's so entertaining it felt even shorter (I just wanted to keep watching!), while not groundbreaking or anythign the movie kept... subverting my expectations. It's also very funny at times. Check it out!

___
#17. [Attack the Block \(2011\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/attack_the_block)

**Wholeheartedly recommend!** This was freakin' awesome. So far - this is the 2nd best movie I've seen during this challenge (1st being Prisoners). I'm so surprised this movie isn't talked about more. I know it has a cult status, but I've only seen it on 2 recommendation lists or so when making my own ""to watch"" list. This is Assault on Precinct 13, Dredd, Hot Fuzz, World's End, The Warriors, marvel movies and a lot more - all put together. And it works wonderfully! This movie is relentless, it never slows down. It looks slick as all hell, and the soundtrack is spot on. If it wasn't for naruto and a few other pop culture references this would have been a perfect movie. Watch it, and recommend it to your friends! 

___
#18. [Nebraska \(2013\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nebraska)

**Recommend.** This reminded me way too much of The Straight Story (in a good way), though the similarities are only in roadtrip and old man tale. Everyone is old. Old people acting old and old people not acting their age is something that I have to deal with on a daily basis cause my sick 80yo grandfather lives with me. This at times was way too real. But personal reasons aside - this is an excellent film. The acting is great, the storytelling is great, and it looks BEAUTIFUL. It's amazing in black and white. If you want something modern in b/w that's good - this is it.

___
#19. [Dogtooth \(2010\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dogtooth)

**Not recommending this, stay far away.** The movie is boring (both visually and in the story department). Okay, so there is this thing happening. I get it. Oh but look it's still happening. I get it, ok? No no, there's more(!) of the same thing that you saw already. Okay okay, but there's gonna be a good payoff to all this in the end, right? Nope. If this was some sort of social commentary or whatever - it was completely lost on me.

___
#20. [Ghost World \(2001\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_world)

**Wholehearted recommendation.** I can recommend this to anyone and everyone, but I especially recommend this to late teens, young adults. This movie is great on so many levels. On all levels in fact. It's super funny, real engaging and it hit me in the feels so hard. I was also an angsty teen (though not a cute girl, sigh) and a lot of that is still with me (fear of change, fear of letting go of things)... Not that this is some high commentary, but I pretty much had a chance to look at things from a side perspective. Not gonna ramble anymore, I'm officially changing this to 2nd best movie I've seen this month so far, with Attack the Block being a close 3rd. See this!

___
#21. [A Serious Man \(2009\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_serious_man)

**A lukewarm recommendation**. I've seen many Coen brothers films, and this one is nowhere near Fargo or The Big Lebowski for me. I even liked Burn After Reading better. That's not to say it's bad, maybe I'm just tired, cause I just watched it after sleeping after a night shift. And while it had its moments - it kinda slowed down in the 2nd half and I didn't get any sort of feeling of satisfaction from it by the end like I usually do with Coen brothers films. Overall it's good enough to recommend, but not great by my standards. I may rewatch this again to re-evaluate it for myself, cause all the elements seem to be in place. Dunno.

___
#22. [Thief \(1981\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1021230_thief)

Awesome. **Recommend!** This is from the same director who did Collateral that I watched earlier in the challenge. And it shows. Though this is slower paced (Collateral takes place all in 1 day, so things happen fast) you can tell it's the same guy. Visually - this movie gave me Bullitt vibes, except for some slick night shots with neon lights / reflections, that made it look almost modern. The story is nothing groundbreaking I guess, but seeing it through was very enjoyable. Music by Tangerine Dream was awesome as well, can't not mention that. Great.

___
#23. [Black Dynamite \(2009\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_dynamite/)

**Recommend.** I have no idea what I expected of this, but what I got was really funny (and at times clever too). I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I saw anything at all that it parodies, but even on its own it's a solid solid film. Really not much more to say here. It's short and sweet.

___
#24. [Kelly's Heroes \(1970\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kellys_heroes)

**Wholeheartedly recommend!** Great movie. It's a WW2 comedy/action-adventure film about a small squad pursuing their own goals. The film was filmed in Panavision and whatever they did to transfer it to bluray - the job was AMAZING. The movie is gorgeous to look at. So much detail, the colors are so crisp. The practical effects/explosions look wonderful, and scenes with a lot of extras really show the scope of what's possible with the best technology of the time. The acting was great by everyone, Clint Eastwood frowns a lot, and is stern and stoic. Also the entire flow of the movie is great. It slows down / speeds up at times, but it always keeps you engaged in the story. One thing bothered me about the characters, and I realized what it was halfway through the film. One character is not from a WW2 era. He's more like someone out of Vietnam war, you see all the hippie dippie stuff from that time you assume that's what it was, so this character was out of place in historical context. But for the movie - he works great, and when I realized what exactly was bothering me - I disregarded it and enjoyed the film. As can you! Check it out.

___
#25. [Death Proof \(2007\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_proof)

**Recommend!** I've seen Planet Terror many times (first in the year it was released, as soon as DVDrip was released on the web), but I've never seen Death Proof for some reason. Majority of the articles that try to make some sort of list of Quentin Tarantino's films put Death Proof at the very end, as the worst film. Is that true? Well, I still haven't seen all of them (working on it!) but yeah, probably it is his worst movie. Does that make it a bad film? Heeeeeellll naaaaww! It's just that all that he does is so good - that even a good film pales in comparison to his *great* films. About the movie itself though: **SPOILERS** it's very slow. Pretty much the entire movie is a buildup for the last ~20 minutes or so, and boy oh boy is it worth it. The cool dialogue is here, but it's all mundane stuff about foot massages and weed, even though the flow is still there. Like you remember that scene past the opening in Pulp Fiction where Vincent and Jules talk about foot massages? It's a great scene, but it doesn't really serve greater purpose in the movie (other than a reference to Mrs. Wallace later). Well majority of the dialogue in Death Proof is like that - it doesn't serve the plot at all, just people talking about whatever: weed, getting high, getting laid, foot massages (damn you, confirmed foot fetishist Quentin Tarantino!) so I think that's why a lot of people have a distaste for this film. But as I said - it's all worth it. For me it was anyway, this was probably the greatest car chase I've ever seen in a movie. And even though the film is recent - they use vintage cars, so I had Bullitt flashbacks all throughout (in that - Charger was also the bad guy) until they run into some traffic and I realized ""oh yeah, the film is set in modern times, I member"". Out of the two Grindhouse features I would recommend Planet Terror more, it's more consistently enjoyable all the way through, but Death Proof has earned it's place in my heart also. 

___
#26. [World's Fastest Indian \(2005\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/worlds_fastest_indian/)

**Wholeheartedly recommend!** This was great. It's an amazing story about a guy who finally made his dream come true very late in life. Sir Anthony Hopkins is so lovable in this - I could just hug him. And really his charisma enhances the movie so much, that even though you know how it's supposed to end - you're cheering him on all the way, and hope he succeeds. Or I did anyway. I don't know how true this retelling is to the actual events, but as a movie - this works great. There is one downside to the movie though. The jingle that plays often, you know, the soundtrack - it sounds like a ringtone. Like an actual ringtone from a modern phone. I can't tell you which one, but every time it came on I just wanted someone to answer it already. Eh. The movie also seems very fast paced, events happen like out of a minigun - pew pew pew pew pew pew pew. It never slows down. Not sure if it's good or bad, it was definitely noticeable but I can't say if it had any impact on my viewing experience. Overall though - if you want to watch a ""feel good"" movie - watch this. 

___
#27. [Ed Wood \(1994\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ed_wood)

Another biopic, two in a row. And this one also gets **a recommendation from me**. I liked World's Fastest Indian better, but I do think this is overall a better movie. A lot went in to the craft and recreation of those events. The black and white makes the entire film look surreal (not just the surreal parts). I'm not the biggest fan of either Burton or Depp, but this was good. Overall I was surprised at how sad this was, I thought he enjoyed his life more and it wasn't a constant struggle. Guess it shows how wrong I usually am about things. Overall though, it is all about keeping a positive outlook on life, and chasing your dreams no matter how much they try to run away from you. The ending to this is the definition of ""bittersweet"". Totally worth a watch even if you're not that interested in Ed Wood (like I wasn't).

___
#28. [He Never Died \(2015\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/he_never_died)

**Abso-freakin-lutely recommend!** This was fucking great. I'm gonna start watching more movies this way, I seem to enjoy them better like that. How? All I knew was the title and that it had a positive score on rottentomatoes (and I saw the poster I guess). That's it. No idea what genre it was, the runningtime, who directed it, who stars in it - nothing. Completely blind. And I loved it so much! No spoilers ahead, don't worry, but I have a few things to say about the movie. Stylistically it was like a throwback to 90's movies if you can believe that. I didn't even know that there was a style like that, until I saw it and instantly recognized it, cause I used to watch all kinds of movies (mostly bad ones) in the 90's and early 00's on my VHS player. The score was freakin' great. This movie has what they call ""great atmosphere"" movie. It's a lower budget film, but it uses it's low budgetness to it's advantage. You know how they say ""what you don't see is more exciting than what you do see""? Cause your imagination fills in the blanks, and it's infinitely better than what someone showing you something would be? Well it's like that. But movies are also ""show, don't tell"" so the parts that you don't see are visually implied, not just someone talking about it. Very good use of resources. But also, it doesn't cheap out in places that it shouldn't. It looks like a real movie, all the actors do a great job, the score is great, and the setting is totally believable (not in ultra-realism terms, but in terms of ""yeah that's how things are sometimes"" instead of ""ah that's how things are in these types of movies"").

ANYWAYS, I loved this film. Not better than Prisoners, but I'm at a loss here, it's about on par with both Ghost World and Attack the Block for me. See what I meant in that entering statement where I said I'm bad at giving things a rating? I can't even decide which movie I like better, and it hasn't been that long since I saw the previous two (and I just saw this). So I'm throwing away the entire concept, there's just one BEST film that I saw (Prisoners, unless I see something better in 2 days) and there are honorable mentions (Attack the Block, Ghost World, He Never Died) no 2nd or 3rd place. I know that on a technical level both Attack the Block and Ghost World are better (higher budget, better actors, etc) but on a pure enjoyment level for me personally - they're equal. So that's that.

See this film! I recommeeeeeeeend it!!

___
#29. [Spring \(2015\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spring_2015)

**A lukewarm recommendation.** There's a lot I liked about this movie, but there are also flaws that made it much worse. **Minor spoilers ahead.** The concept is great, and the mystery is dulled out sparingly. Until they just stop doing that and explain everything. I guess I wasn't expecting that the movie would go in that direction, but once it did - it became super formulaic. You see the ending coming a mile away. But that mile is so long - here is the biggest problem, the movie is 2 hours and you feel every minute of that, because it's low budget and they have to pad the time (maybe?). That works as advantage too, you really see the connection that forms between characters. Wouldn't have worked if they rushed it. But the dull moments are so dull, ugh... I wanted to speed it up some. And as I said - at certain point I got where it was going with the ending, and I was just waiting for it to happen (and it did, but boy did it take long). Good: the acting was actually good. Main actor seemed like really generic at first, but halfway through the film you really get that it's that kind of person he's portraying. There were few jokes, but all of them were good. Not like a big laugh out loud moment, but a honest to god chuckle was had. The effects for a low budget flick were quite good (and at times obviously fake...). Anyway, I'm torn on this, I want to recommend it, so I am, but it's definitely not for everyone. **It's a good horror movie to watch with a date. It's not too scary, and there's a boy meets girl plotline.**

___
#30. [Turbo Kid \(2015\)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/turbo_kid)

**Recommend!** Based on what the premise and from what I heard of execution - I thought I would enjoy this movie a lot more than I did. I did enjoy it but... Well, this is a movie that I think would benefit a lot more from bigger budget than other lower-budget films I saw previously. Every scene feels just a bit longer than it should be, and it adds up unfortunately. That and - I'm sure the directors wanted it to be more varied, but the same locations are used constantly. Those are the main problems. Everything else - perfect. The setting (a post-apocalyptic future of 1997), the actors, the music. Oh god the music, it hit all the right spots for me. I'm a sucker for synthwave and this was great. I heard people compare this to Kung Fury. Thankfully it's not like that at all, it's a real movie not a fucking joke. It felt a lot more like Hobo With a Shotgun rather than Kung Fury, and if it had the same fast pace of Hobo With A Shotgun - I would have loved it with all my heart. But as is - it's a flawed gem. Shiny but, you can see the imperfections.

##*WHOA! Has it been 30 days already?! Hell yeah it has! I finished it! I feel so proud. I literally did nothing but entertain myself, but somehow I feel like I've accomplished something. \#Firstworldvictories ? You decide. So what did I gain from this? I got my to-watch list down by 30 movies, which is great but nowhere near enough to even get to a quarter of the total done. I realized that it's a good idea to do this challenge and a bad idea too. When I enjoyed movies - I enjoyed them a lot. Problem was watching something I didn't necessarily like on days that I'm tired. A couple of times I came home at ~22-23 after a 14h shift and I was completely drained, but I watched the movie anyway. At those times I really didn't want to. Other times I felt like if I wasn't watching a movie right now - I'd just be wasting time doing nothing, just answering questions on /r/askreddit sorted by new or something, so at those times - it was perfect to watch a film. Overall I think it was totally worth it. I can confirm that by no means would I make it through a 365 movies a year challenge, but maybe after a few months break - I could do with another monthly challenge. Definitely taking that break though.*

##*I've tried my best to diversify what I'm watching, and I think I did OK. I've seen some horror stuff, some comedies, some classics, a lot of new stuff, low budget films and high budget block-busters, a couple of foreign films. I hope that this list will help you find something you'd want to watch also. To summ it up - the best film I've seen this month is* ***Prisoners.*** *And honorable mentions go to* ***Ghost World,*** ***Attack the Block,*** ***He Never Died.*** *Other movies were good too, but these were the ones that I enjoyed the most. Your experiences and opinions may differ of course, and that's great cause that means you're an individual with your own tastes!*

Good luck, happy watching, and stay positive. I know I am. Wink wink."

A lot of these deal with issues like loneliness, depression, and finding your place in the world. These are roughly in chronological order by release date, but I won't put a movie on here if I didn't enjoy it myself. I'll make another list below this one comprised of what gets recommended in the comments. Hopefully we can get more of these lists made for first-time visitors to this sub.

*Promising Young Woman* was a well-acted revenge story with a great soundtrack, compelling premise, and colorful aesthetic. This movie is a bold and excellent directorial debut for Emerald Fennell.¬†Carey Mulligan gave an absolutely amazing performance!

It was disturbing and intense, but also entertaining, clever, and surprisingly funny.

There's so much truth in it that I think everybody needs to see it. And even if you don‚Äôt enjoy it, I think it‚Äôll at least leave you with something dark and real to think about.

I remember watching Shaun the Sheep (show) when I was a kid a long with Wallace and Gromitt but watching the Shaun the Sheep movie I felt sad and happy and found it to be a comedy that was actually funny. It's not my favorite animated film of all time but it's definitely a great one that everyone should watch.

I define good movies to be 8+ or if you abhor grades, the top 20% of movies you've seen. Films listed here will be added to the subreddit's [Top 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/meta/top100). What are the top films you saw in May 2020 and why?  Here are my picks:

---

# Clue (1985)

Wow, what a great comedy. All of the actors do wonderfully and Tim Curry manages to steal the show while letting each actor shine. Lots of fun gags, irony and dark humour about death. Who cares if it is inspired by a board game? Watch it on the merits of being very funny.

# Fermat's Room (2007)

Strangers trapped in a race against time and I can feel your eyes rolling. Fermat's Room has a twist of the protagonists in peril are logicians who need to solve puzzles or the room they're stuck in gets smaller. Lots of good twists, turns and deductive reasoning. A fun, engaging ride in the tradition of Spanish thrillers with social commentary.

# Killing Gunther (2017)

There's a simple litmus test for your enjoyment of this movie: if you quote Arnold Schwarzenegger lines out in the wild, you'll have a blast. The host of colourful characters and their reasons for wanting to kill Gunther are humourus. This movie dances back and forth between homage and parody of the classic Arnie films that you can tell it was made by a fan. Schwarzenegger is having a ball in this role, instead of the grumpy old man who has got to prove ""he's still got it"" like in his other Dad Porn films.

# Haunters (2010)

A psychic sociopath uses and discards people at will finds an honest man who is immune to his powers. At that point, the two are clash in a grim and realistic portrayal of a battle of wits - how an unstoppable force will collide into an immovable object. I like a lot of the supporting cast, with the more serious tone they feel like people instead of comedic relief. A lesser known entry in Korean New Wave that is worth your time if you enjoy genre movies.

# The Holy Mountain (1973)

I thought I knew what The Holy Mountain was and the movie kept breaking me of that assumption. I thought the grotesque was a cheap shot to induce revulsion but it kept my attention rapt. There were moments that had me thinking of being bored and the film snapped my attention back. I did not consent to this sojourn. A mediation, a waste of time; I can see both being applied, both being correct and both culminating in the lesson of The Holy Mountain.

# It Comes at Night (2017)

The tension in this movie is supremely well done, making every moment dreadful and even the good moments will make you hold your breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop. The lighting is fantastic, for a movie that takes place mostly at night and with very little light sources, the film comes through beautifully crisp with stark contrasts. Joel Edgerton heads this drama but everyone pulls their weight in a movie that'll keep you tense throughout the runtime.

# The Little Prince (2015)

What a beautiful Greek Coming of Age fairy tale. The changing animation styles to show whether we're in the parable or 'real life' was a nice tough, especially when the two begin to blend. I'm fond of magic realism used as training wheels for young adults to get a grip on real life and if you are too, I highly recommend The Little Prince.

# Midnight Runners (2017)

What a great blend of genres. Midnight Runners injects Korean New Wave into the 80s Buddy Cop formula and changes it up with the protagonists being students of a police academy. This movie goes from funny gags to the horrors of human cruelty, covering a wide breadth of emotions without the movie running afoul of feeling disjointed. Furthermore, without the ability to use guns, both because of Korea's lack of handguns and the protagonists' status as students, many of the fights are dynamic, interesting and hard fought. With a lot of Korean movies being anti-police, Midnight Runners is a breath of fresh air that takes itself seriously when warranted but isn't afraid to be fun.

# Mom and Dad (2017)

Horror movies have to make it OK for the victims to die; usually it's underage drinking or sex. In Mom and Dad, the victims are OKed just by having the kids be kids and the parents staring at The Wall of irrelevance. For that reason, plus the expert suspense building and a director allowing Nicholas Cage to go unhinged made Mom and Dad a fun time. Cell phones removal is integral to horror plots to prevent the easy out of authorities and I applaud the smart script that made the removal very organic. If you're not a fan of horror comedies, skip it; if you enjoy horror comedies however, you're doing yourself a disservice by not checking this out.

# The Platform (2019)

Man, Spaniards sure do know how to make political commentary with their thrillers. The concept is neat and pulls back the ugly mask of class warfare. The stark contrast between beautifully prepared meals and grotesque injuries of the inmates may bother those who are squeamish. I also found the brutalism architecture to be on point of the very little we see outside of the jail.

# Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)

My god, Noemie Merlant has some of the most beautiful and intense eyes. Celine Sciamma uses them like a goddamn weapon; each shot consists of Merlant's eyes or almost a first person perspective of Merlant's character's perception. I was entranced throughout the entire movie, my options were being mesmerized by what I saw or what she saw. The acting, cinematography and period costumes all look great but those pale in comparison to what the lens bore through me. With a movie on how women are seen and how they see each other, this was a once-in-a-lifetime casting.

# Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978)

Snake in the Eagle's Shadow is a wuxia comedy in the same vein as a lot of horror comedies. They respect their parent genre but have no problem going to an extreme for a laugh. A young Jackie Chan does some amazing choreography in this one and pushes himself to the limit: you can tell he lost a tooth in a fight near the end. If you're a fan of Shaw Brothers martial arts you deserve to check this one out.

# TerrorVision (1986)

The most 80s B movie to ever 80s B movie. It has spectacular monster effects, cheesy acting, its own theme song and aspects that just feels like it was produced on cocaine. The parents are neglectful because they're arranging to be swingers, the daughter brings back her new boyfriend who the mother blatantly checks out and an Elvira knock-off somehow becomes a plot point. You're either sold by now or know this entertaining piece of garbage isn't for you, I quite like my 80s junk food.

# The Wandering Earth (2019)

Every Sci-Fi trope directed in a way that would make Roland Emmerich proud but made in China. The Wandering Earth is stupid fun; make sure your limbs are within the vehicle at all times, ensure your brain is properly stowed away and prepare to have a blast. If you're not into the rollicking Blockbusters, then this isn't for you, though I am surprised by the mild Chinese jingoism when they could've went hog wild with this sort of movie.

I define good movies to be 8+ or if you abhor grades, the top 20% of movies you've seen. Here are my picks:

---

# Angel-A

Luc Besson's flashy style adds bite to essentially a movie about self-reflection. The screw up protagonist meets an angel when he decides to kill himself and she proceeds to help him fix himself. Besson's edge is what makes the moralistic tale about loving yourself be embodied in a leggy, chain smoking platinum blonde. Angel-A wasn't boring or preachy due to Besson's style, though it might get in the way of a beautiful film about falling in love with yourself.

# Aquaman

Aquaman is a good adventure movie and I can easily see why it would be disliked by so many: it treats the Aquaman mythos seriously. This is an epic involving dynasties and legends with superpowered individuals. Aquaman is bloated but I forgive it due to treating the nature of the comics respectfully, there's a lot of moving parts that need to be addressed even if they should have been cut. Normally, DC's godlike heroes are a problem for suspension of disbelief but somehow, by being under the sea, all of the superheroics are somehow more believable and are incredibly well-shot. I really enjoyed Aquaman but I cannot universally recommend it.

# Captain Marvel

It's a Marvel movie, you should know by now if such a statement is a compliment or condemnation. I liked how Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson played off of each other. The fighting is easy to see without shakey-cam; however, the cuts are frequent enough I know when stars and stunts swap. There are some solid comedic moments, a plot that has enough twists to keep things interesting and a good character arc for Larson's Captain Marvel - even if it had to use amnesia as a tired trope. CG augments are excellent but it becomes incredibly fake looking as soon as Marvel starts flying around. All in all, a Marvel movie. What Black Panther did for African Americans regarding identity, I can easily see Captain Marvel doing the same for Feminism.

# Dirty Ho

Another fun Shaw Brothers production where the main gimmick is the protagonist is an idiot and fights a man who hides his true kung fu skill. Now indentured to this mystery man, the comedy unfurls among sight gags and impressive martial arts. This is a bog standard martial arts movie but the Shaw Brothers' production has an eye for elevating it to a dramatic and impressive level with camerawork that lets you see the impressive feats.

# Dragged Across Concrete

Each character spits grizzled Noir for every sentence and S. Craig Zahler does not deviate from this aesthetic. There are no people in this movie, merely relics of a bygone age who are set on a collision course with each other. I watched the movie because I knew Zahler's style is unique and unseen in modern productions. He delivers in spades, using each actor wonderfully as a stand-in for the trope they're supposed to embody. You'll enjoy Dragged Across Concrete if the idea of gratuitous action movies of yore condescendingly told you how things were 'back in the golden age'. I love old school action movies so I had fun indulging Zahler's grumbling reminiscence.

# Glass

Shyamalan sneaks in so many interesting layers in what should be a fairly straight forward superhero showdown. He got Bruce Willis to not phone it in, he harnessed the know-it-all charisma of Samuel L. Jackson, recaptured the intensity of James McAvoy, used the kill-with-kindness of Sarah Paulson and courageous vulnerability of Anya Taylor-Joy. On top of great acting, Glass used mostly practical for its effects, keeping within the theme of ""low key, believable"" heroes and so the camera did shoot around the actors but I forgive that for the attempt of practicals. Glass is a love letter to the superhero genre and Shyamalan makes it his own.

# Heroes of the East

What a delightfully wholesome premise to watch a bunch of martial arts; two newlywed martial artists misunderstand each other over differences between Chinese and Japanese martial arts. The cuts were a little more jarring than I remember of most Shaw Brothers productions, but otherwise the martial arts of various styles are showcased wonderfully with a workmanlike camera. If you're a fan of martial arts movies, check this one out!

# Lady Snowblood

I never would have thought of carnage as beautiful but Lady Snowblood does so. I can easily see where Quentin Tarantino cribbed notes for Kill Bill. A girl raised to avenge her family, Lady Snowblood stabs and slices her way through enemies who spray blood when slain. This is purely an exploitation film, with gore and nudity, yet Lady Snowblood takes time to set a beautiful aesthetic among the carnage.

# Lawrence of Arabia

This might be the best movie I've ever seen. The script is phenomenal, asking the question of whether man can change his destiny. The technical merit is unbelievable, creating some of the most coordinated set pieces with real actors. The cinematography turns each frame into a painting that draws you in. The directing of characters and scenes is sublime, where blocking is important for the people's relationships to knowing how much to let the audience drink in the scenery. The acting is superb, with each actors providing nuanced, fully fleshed out characters. I was intimidated for years to watch this four hour epic but I am glad that I had the maturity to marvel at it now.

# Life is Beautiful

Somehow, this is a charming, funny story full of heart about a man trying to shield his son from the horrors of a concentration camp. I wouldn't think that such a topic could be made so lighthearted and I must praise Robert Benigni for pulling it off with his direction and acting. Life is Beautiful shows that living your life to fullest is the best you can do.

# Triple Frontier 

J.C. Chandor commands an excellent eye, making this star-studded action-thriller check all marks. A group of five ex-Special Forces decide to rob a crime lord due to feeling that America hasn't paid them back for their time. What makes Triple Frontier interesting is these uber-competent men are tested in unfamiliar territory: operating without their moral compass. They're ready for every challenge that comes their way except when freed of their military oath, they aren't prepared to curb their abandonment, bitterness and greed.

# Us

Us is good, though I am left disappointed because of over-the-top expectations that Get Out left me. Lupita Nyong'o is excellent, unsettling and nuanced. Each actor nails it, expressing a whole array of emotions in this Jordan Peele production. Us goes more for the commentary than fright, which I found disappointing, but the thriller aspects are engaging. Peele used blocking well, his director-of-photography for a good look and none of the movie is wasted as it starts slow but never relents.

# The Wall (2017)

I'm impressed with how much director Doug Limon does with so little. John Cena and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are superb as the only cast of a movie where they are pinned by a sniper. Yeah, I just complemented a former WWE star on his acting. There's real camaraderie between the two and a character study of the two under pressure. This is not an action movie, but a drama about what type of person you become when you're put up against The Wall.

94,Actually funny family-comedy movies for an adult family?,29,e8ks11,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/e8ks11/actually_funny_familycomedy_movies_for_an_adult/,49,1575976192.0,"What's a good movie I can watch as an adult (20F) with my family members (mom, dad, and 30F sister) without it being a movie for children? Whenever I try and search for comedy family movies into google I get a bunch of animated movies.

I'm looking more for movies like The Princess Bride, Mrs. Doubtfire, Coming to America, Rush Hour, Meet the Parents, Jumanji, Matilda, Are We There Yet, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Big (Tom Hanks), Evan Almighty, Step Brothers, Beverly Hills Cop, Blue Streak, Bad Boys, etc. Movies that are really light-hearted, have some action or adventure, and really make you laugh would be good.

I'm \*not\* looking for movies like Scary Movie 2, Pineapple Express, Euro Trip, or American Pie if you get my drift. It would obviously be kind of uncomfortable to watch these kinds of movies with my family in the room.

96,Top 100 - May 2020 is Up,30,gysj7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/gysj7s/top_100_may_2020_is_up/,7,1591621846.0,"Trying this out instead of the regularly scheduled Hang Outs because they were a little lacklustre. Here, a thread where you can be informal about what you're talking about but there's still a topic!

I've taken all of the comments from the [May 2020 Round-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/guc7xd/best_movies_seen_may_2020/) and they've been applied to the [Top 100 for May 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/meta/top100/may2020). Any comments added to that thread until the end of the month will be added to the June count. A little lower turn out that regular but I'm not surprised, it's the summer and the numbers tend to drop around that time.

There's a great deal of shuffling, mostly because I double counted my numbers and was surprised at how many I missed. So, a few of the new movies have popped up this month that should have already been on the list. I could go back and try to make previous records accurate but screw that noise.

These movies fell off the Top 100:

- Dolemite is My Name (2019)
- Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
- Freaks (2018)
- Gone Girl (2014)
- The Guilty (2018)
- The Hunt (2012)
- In Bruges (2008)
- Incendies (2010)
- The Invisible Man (2020)
- Memento (2000)
- Pain and Glory (2019)
-  Paprika (2006)
- Phantom Thread (2017)

I've seen them all except Dolemite is My Name, Incendies and The Phantom Thread. I didn't give Eyes Wide Shut an 8+ but everything else on that list is worth tracking down. I'm very fond of Satoshi Kon so I'm saddened to see Paprika go. I think I'll eventually get to Incendies when I want to see more Villeneuve but I am not in any particular hurry; I think I'd watch Dolemite is My Name first because it sounds so entertaining. Not the biggest fan of period dramas and PTA, so I think it's safe to skip The Phantom Thread.

These movies climbed into the Top 100:

- 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)
- Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007)
- Birds of Prey (2020)
- Chinatown (1974)
- Cinema Paradiso (1988)
- The Death of Stalin (2017)
- Doctor Sleep (2019)
- The Farewell (2019)
- Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)
- Rope (1948)
- Snowpiercer (2013)
- Train to Busan (2016)
- Witness for the Prosecution (1957)

I've seen them all except for The Farewell and Witness for the Prosecution. I'll toss The Farewell far onto the back of my backburner, it's probably great and good cinema to watch but I just crave the junk food that entertains. I hadn't really heard of Witness for the Prosecution before but considering it's actual Noir instead of Neo Noir, I'll track it down. The actual purpose of the sub, finding something you didn't know you wanted, achieved! I don't agree with 8+ on Birds of Prey and The Death of Stalin; I found the former too uneven and I didn't find the latter to be funny. The rest though, yeah, give them a shot!

As for the list, I'm fairly pleased to see a mix of oldies and modern movies, even though the list does suffer from some recency bias.

What's your thoughts on the Top 100, what fell off and what climbed onto?"

The President commissions a public relations guru(DeNiro) to fix him problem. In order to keep the limelight off of the alleged presidential affair, DeNiro, with the help of a Hollywood producer friend(Hoffman), comes up with the idea of faking a war in a far off country(Albania) for the eyes of American populous.

---

# The Blob (1988)

The Blob defied my expectations by showing that no one is safe. The effects are graphic and gory, I was quite surprised. By the time the movie was using janky split screens, it had bought enough forgiveness. My initial hesitation is conflating the 50's version of campiness for this serious, satisfying horror flick.

# The Brand New Testament (2015)

God's an asshole and his daughter runs away from home to Brussels, the first place God created. By now you know if you've been offended out on this quirky comedy or if you're intrigued. Each of God's daughter's disciples brings out more blasphemy but never in a malicious way; just a poke at overarching institutions. I had fun with how this movie dismisses organized religion in favour of personal belief but I know that can be a deal breaker for many.

# The Gangster, the Cop and the Devil (2019)

Definitely a Korean New Wave entry with thuggish cops and honour-bound gangsters who put their differences aside to track down a serial killer. These compromised cops and crooks need to deal with the killer as well as the politics of their overarching organizations which created an interesting tension. Great cinematography and fight scenes in this thriller are better than most of the field.

# It's Such a Beautiful Day (2012)

I can't believe the same guy who made the ""My anus is bleeding"" cheering clouds from the early aughts made such a beautiful, poignant and sad examination of life forgotten. Hertzfeld brings his iconic style that somehow feels looser than his attempted career suicide which instead launched him into notoriety. I think he's being gentle because any tighter and the subject matter would slip away. Solidly avant garde and art house, those keywords would sell you on It's Such a Beautiful Day by now or not.

# Never Let Me Go (2010)

I suppose I was able to avoid the gut punch just by being cynical but Never Let Me Go got me anyway. The performances from the children to their adult versions were incredible. The movie looks crisp and beautiful. It's hard to criticize a movie that moves towards the futile when the entire point is to accept that's just life.

# Project A (1983)

Project A could have easily fallen to the trap of organizational feuding but I praise the theme of cooperation. This is your stock standard Jackie Chan 80s vehicle. The gags are funny, the stunts are mesmerizing and you feel for the characters he builds up. If you've seen his other works in his prime, Project A is oft neglected to be mentioned which is a shame. If you haven't seen peak Chan, Project A can be a great introduction.

# The Quiet Earth (1985)

The workmanlike camera adds gravity to the protagonist's predicament: everyone but him has disappeared. The Quiet Earth delivers a great contemplative Sci-Fi on what you'd do with yourself; from the freedom to do what you will, the little projects to keep yourself sane and the refusal to admitting you're cracking. The few minutes spent on the protagonist's sexuality when freed from societal pressure must've been revelatory when this was released and why I suspect The Quiet Earth has been suppressed when it comes to best Sci-Fi. The science is solid, the acting is as well; if you love Sci-Fi give The Quiet Earth a shot.

# The Spy Gone North (2018)

Korean New Wave is used in a spy thriller and it works; we've replaced ambiguous police and robbers with nationals who want the best for their half of Korea. Well shot, of course, and solid camerawork. I never felt like one side got off easy and that's a great change instead of the America jingoistic spy thrillers I'm used to.

# T-34 (2018)

I was expecting 300 but with tanks, as all the previews showed slow motion shots following a tank's shell. T-34 is more than that, it's pretty smart by showing how much thought and counter-thought needs to go into tank battles where one hit could be the end. I thought T-34 was going to be all action, that's not the case, there's a nice dose of drama to along with it as well. I think that helped balance the insane tank sabots.

# Toc Toc (2017)

A fun dramedy about people with OCD having to put up with each other while waiting for a late doctor. This easily could have been done in poor taste, punching down on those with mental illnesses, but instead celebrates learning to manage mental illness. The movie treats OCD seriously and keeps things lighthearted enough for the laughs; the cast's charisma prop this Toc Toc up to be an overall joy.

# The Wicker Man (1973)

I look for the new and interesting in the film medium, I would say that a film that surprises me is one of the most delightful things. I couldn't imagine a folk horror from over 40 years ago could do that, so I was caught off-guard by The Wicker Man. What a musical mystery! There's tons of songs and singing while the protagonist tries to make headway into the esoteric pagan society who seems entirely uncooperative in helping him. This movie cleverly leads you into a conclusion that only feels natural instead of forced. The actors, screenwriting, camerawork and DP bring their A-Game to aid the director in making an amazing movie.

# Witness for the Prosecution (1957)

I can definitely agree with the assessment of Witness for the Prosecution being noir. I wasn't sure how a courtroom drama could pull off the required tropes of playing with light, the femme fatale and the man who is forced to understand the circumstances thrust upon him. Despite being over 60 years old, Witness felt fresh, especially with its solid camerawork and reliance on actors who could do work. If you're even ancillary interested in noir, courtroom dramas or checking out classics, I recommend Witness for the Prosecution.

First order of business, the rules have been overhauled after the last few months of suggestions.

I've reduced the amount of rules, as per a suggestion. Previously, I tried to make it as obvious as possible. Now I'm going for a more minimum approach.

- Rule 3: Specifies that Requests that want to use non-text must be in the body of your post.
- Rule 4: The most contentious rule. Suggestions now must be clearly labelled, use the title, indicate if it is in theatres (this previously was a different rule, I've put it under one heading), links must be to neutral sources, non-text must be in the body of your post and you cannot Suggest Barred movies which are listed in the Sticky. These movies are listed in the Sticky. This does not mean you cannot suggest them to Requests, it just means you can't make a new individual post about them. A single suggestion, waiting six months and to not use this subreddit as your link farm are not new. Hopefully, with the requirement of using Letterboxd, Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB, people will see that their Suggest was made within six months.
- Rule 6: Clarified that posts to full length movies are considered piracy. I've removed an explanation; those who care about the subreddit know and those who don't, don't.
- Rule 7: Clarified exactly what 'No Shilling' meant.

The next town hall to make changes will be in two months. Try these changes out and tell the community how you feel about them.

This movie has Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, and the beautiful Claire Forlani. It's funny, spectacular, and philosophical.

Anthony plays a great role with unfathomable wisdom, while Claire is a beautiful doe-eyed resident at a local hospital. This movie is a love story, a life changer, and an all around great film. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a ""feel good about your life"" film. "

131,Event Horizon,23,mmy3mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/mmy3mu/event_horizon/,8,1617935142.0,"I‚Äôve seen this movie pop up on here a number of times and was tepid to watch. I finally got around to watching last night, and am writing this suggestion for those like me who are aware of EH but haven‚Äôt dug in for whatever reason. WATCH THIS MOVIE.

The story is great and actually scary, the acting is good enough... over the top at times but whatever you‚Äôll be into it.

Only critique is with Lawrence Fishburns rotating captain chair... kinda distracting, definitely funny, to see him rotate like 10 degrees to talk to somebody during some of the early scenes. I like to imagine there is somebody behind the camera saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt just turn ur head use the chair!‚Äù"

Maybe the stupid funny type of humor isn't well regarded with critics. Well is was definitely my cup of tea and, I'm on a path to find every movie like this which may have been buried by rt/mc."
134,[Request] Recent comedies that are actually funny?,20,3d5bfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/3d5bfj/request_recent_comedies_that_are_actually_funny/,45,1436836805.0,"There seems to be a huge lack of comedies with actual humor in them these days, or maybe I'm just having a real hard time finding them! Either way, my boyfriend and I are really craving something funny to watch. We are into the older ""stoner-ish"" types of comedies, like Grandma's Boy, Big Lebowski, Fear & Loathing, The Birdcage, Half Baked, you get the picture. Doesn't have to be weed-related, but something genuinely funny.

We've tried watching a few recent ones, like Superbad and Movie 43. Superbad was okay, but Movie 43 was just...ugh, *so* awful. We're looking for movies that aren't just all, ""HAHAHA tits, HAHA balls, HAHAH sex is so taboo & funny!"" Basically, if my 14 year old nephew is going to bust up laughing at it, it's probably a bit immature and not really what we're in the mood for. You know what I mean?

Anyways, I hope you guys have some suggestions for us! We're going to try 21 Jump Street here in a moment, fingers crossed."

It‚Äôs a gritty action film with high stakes, but it still feels charming, stylish, good-natured and able to be funny without undermining itself.

There are a couple of films that are worth watching though. The Belgians made some weird and wonderful films.  
(P.S. Belgium is a multilingual country, so you will see titles in Dutch, French and international titles.)  
  
Koen Mortier so far made two full length films. **Ex Drummer** (2007) is a completely over the top film about violent lowlife scum that form a band. Not for the faint hearted, but with great humor.  
The other film is something completely different: **22 Mei** (22nd of May, 2010). A man works at a shopping mall where an explosion takes place. The film keeps telling the same story from another perspective. Interesting!  
  
**Nuit Noir** (2005) a weird and dark thriller/horror. Some people compare it to the work of David Lynch, but even though it is dark and weird with a droning soundtrack too, it doesn't look like Lynch to me.
  
**Linkeroever** (Left Bank, 2008). Another weird and dark thriller with horror elements, nice and gloomy.  
Of the same director (Pieter van Hees) is **Dirty Mind** (2009) which is an alright somewhat weird comedy.  
And again Van Hees. **Waste Land** (2014) a very descent thriller.  
  
I have seen two films of Fabrice du Welz. **Calvaire** (Ordeal, 2004) is a very dark and somewhat weird horror (not of the slasher kind) and **Vinyan** (2008) is a fairly common Hollywood type thriller.  
  
I also saw three films of Felix van Groeningen. **Belgica** (2016) is a fun and musical film about friends that start a club. **Broken Circle Breakdown** (2012) is a good, but very depressive drama. **De Helaasheid der Dingen** (The Misfortunates, 2009) is a fun and light comedy about some lowlife fellows.  
  
By other directors:  
**D'Ardennen** (2015) a dark and descent thriller.    
**Black** (2015) a lauded film about youthful love in a suburb of Brussel.  
**Loft** (2008) an alright drama/thriller about a group of men with a secret apartment. There is a remake of this film.  
**Le Tout Nouveau Testament** (The Brand New Testament, 2015) a weird comedy in which God is a lowlife living in Brussel.  
**Film 1** (or Piranha Blues) (1999) a slightly weird and descent drama.  
**Rundskop** (Bullhead, 2011) and excellent thriller about the hormones maffia.  
**Any Way The Wind Blows** (2003) a funny and musical drama by Tom Barman of the band Deus.  
**Aaltra** (2004) an absurd comedy.  
**Stupeur et Tremblements** (2003) a Belgian look on Japanese culture. A drama/comedy.  
  
Which titles did I miss?

It's a retelling of Red Riding Hood presented as a mystery-comedy."

I HIGHLY suggest this movie with a side of your favorite Tegridy brand strain. 

BENNY HILL is in this movie! I was like ""look it's Benny Hill"". (eyes glazed, looking at my wife like I just made a funny joke) Looking back at the TV, my slow mind began to realize that yes, this is Benny Hill as I shouted out to Google ""Was Benny Hill in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?"" ""Yes, Benny Hill was in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""
Google answered like this was the last time she was ever going to answer this question. 

I don't think I'm the only person who was surprised to see this. 

Anyway, he was pretty awesome in it and man oh man, there is so much Dick Van Dyke goodness in this film. 

The bamboo stick dance and the toy dance stick out to me.

Anyway, I've been kind of into the big, polished, wide angled, MGM type films as of late. There are alot I haven't seen. The ones with the large shot musical scenes that are fun to watch on your projector. 

What are your favorites and suggestions for me?

Also, if you could recommend films that have like the Benny Hill thing. Someone you totally don't expect to be in it. Thanks!"

It centres around a completely unhinged performance from Robert Mitchum as a serial killer up there with other great mad cinematic killers like Norman Bates and Anton Chigurgh. The film lurches between hokey Hollywood melodrama, fairytale-like musical sequences and serene but gruesome imagery - it's more disturbing than you'd perhaps expect from a '50s studio production, but it's funny at the same time. The photography is expressionistic and makes wonderful use of light and shade.

And the writing is pure poetry. There's something deeply sinister about preachers, and this film taps into that much as many other films find the latent horror in clowns. Mitchum's preacher is a highly verbose Judge Holden type, capable of long, hypnotically beautiful monologues but also brimming with his sexually repressed desires. The Freudian symbolism in the film is relentless and in many ways you feel stuck in this character's twisted mind.

There's a moment before the dreamy boat sequence where the villain, pursuing his targets with a knife and half submerged in river water, sings a note which turns into a shriek of anguish so piercing it become, for me, one of the most eye-opening film moments of recent memory.

See it!"

I had become a bit disillusioned with my job recently which ironically is heavily involved with the film industry and was seriously considering quitting until I decided that I needed to watch more movies in order to remember the reasons for why I got into the job I'm doing in the first place. 

I've made my way through about a quarter of the folder so far and I have been adding other movies that have piqued my interest over the years I still haven't gotten around to watching yet but I'm starting to hit a wall on what is worth watching next. 

My favorite film I've seen out of all the ones inside that folder was definitely Pi and close behind are Last Year at Marienbad (which I watched twice) and The Purple Rose of Cairo (best movie about films ever made). There have been a few disappointments as well such as Enemy and having to withstanding the pretentious tedium of Cremaster 3 for 3 hours straight but most have been worth it. I just don't want to waste my precious free time on the weekend watching something that isn't worth it anymore. 

This is the full list of movies I am still yet to watch all the way through:

Carnival of Souls

collective-unconscious

The remaining parts of Cremaster (Cremaster 1, 2 and 5)

Dogtooth

Fantastic Planet

Freaks

Funny Games (the original)

Holy Motors 

Human Traffic Remixed (probably not a good idea to watch this)

I'm A Cyborg But That's OK

Julien Donkey Boy

La Moustache

Meet The Applegates

My Dinner With Andre (attempted to watch this more than once)

Pee Wee's Big Adventure

Tetsuo: The Iron Man (have also attempted to watch this more than once but have found myself too squeamish to endure watching it after a certain point despite the fact it only goes for an hour)

The Driller Killer

Visitor Q

Wax or The Discovery of Television Among the Bees

What movies out of all of these would be worth watching the most? I've only really got a limited amount of time on the weekend in the evenings to watch movies anymore and I don't want to waste it watching something disappointing like Enemy again. What are your suggestions for the best ones to watch here? Feel free to add further suggestions for movies similar to the ones listed I might also enjoy.

---

# Bot

/u/yzalthree made a Bot. It mostly works. How do people feel about it?

To make it work better, we should do something about increasing its hit chance. Right now it'll practically look up anything. What, if any, modifiers should we use? Should we have the bot read only **Bold** lines or only include movies with years; such as The Matrix (1999). Or change it into a bot you summon instead of one that automatically replies after 14 hours (I think it's 14).

# Character Count

We implemented a 100 character minimum for a post to be posted. This was to curtail massive lists and it seems to be doing the trick. I think I've had to use my spam macros less. It does take more moderation, as posts have an extra hoop to jump through; essentially, if a post gets stuck in our spam filter of low karma/age, we need to manually count the characters if the post is appropriate.

Is the community happy with the posts that been coming up? Keep the rule as is? Abolish? Extend or retract the required amount of characters?

# Shadowbans

It has been pointed out to me that Rule 3 makes it pretty clear that Trolls should get the instant banhammer. Yet we've gone the kinder route of giving them a warning first. We've ahd discussions on whether we should Shadowban these trolls, ban them or whatnot. I'm not too sure what the community would want; a merciful approach, a policed one or just toss trolls out?

Personally, my ban philosophy is attempting to determine if the person is a Good or Bad Actor. If they wish harm upon the subreddit or someone within it, they should just get kicked. These are the people who promote their own shit without realizing we don't want that. It's hard to tell when someone makes a joke; it may be funny but it is at someone's expense. That's where I think warnings may work; they're not a Bad Actor, they just did a Bad Thing.

Good Actors get the three strikes. They have good intentions but they're just a nuisance to constantly clean up after. Usually the process is a warning, a warning linking back to their previous infraction and then ban. If it has been a long time since their previous screw up, such as more than six months, then they get another treatment of warning with a link.

So, how do we go forward with dealing with Trolls? Consider them Bad Actors who get instantly banished, Good Actors who are just making a mess and get a warning? Or do we Shadowban them until we determine if we're going to ban or unshadowban them? I put this question forth to the community.
