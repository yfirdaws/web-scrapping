96,gar13co,t1_gaqyy5n,"Foreshadowing is when in a story, future events that havent happened yet in the story are alluded to. It's usually subtle, and most people will only realize it after the events that are being foreshadowed transpire. Often foreshadowing is only obvious on a second viewing, when you know already what's going to happen.
    
**Spoilers for the ending of In Bruges:**   
The foreshadowing I'm talking about is the dum-dums. The main characters' boss who has come to kill one of them is offered ""dum-dums"" -- ""you know, the special bullets that make the head explode?"" -- and he takes them while saying ""I know I shouldn't....""
   
At the end of the film, when he's shooting at the hitman in his employ that he's trying to kill, one of his stay bullets hits an adult dwarf (they don't like being called midgets) in the head. The dwarf is dressed in a schoolboy's clothes for the movie he's acting in. Since the guy used the dum-dums (I'm guessing they're just hollow-point rounds, which expand greatly upon impact), the dwarf's head indeed explodes, and when the shooter approaches the body, he thinks it's a child. Then he kills himself after explaining that ""you've got to stick to your principles"" -- he earlier in the film said ""if I killed a little kid, accidentally or otherwise, I would kill myself on the spot. **on the fucking spot**"" --
    
So him saying ""I know I shouldn't..."" earlier when buying the dum-dums is foreshadowing how his decision to buy them directly led to his death--by his own hand, no less!",t3_ihuq3y

Other than that, yea it was funny! His manager from New Zealand is hilarious. This would have been way better with a better comic female lead, someone who can relax and crack a joke, even Kristin bell has a sense of humor compared to dead-face zoey.",t3_jzywv0

130,gdgnh4h,t1_gdf0m0u,"Not really sure about any of that.The flims you mentioned came out close to 15 years apart, and between those he had dramatic and/or darker comedic roles, in Truman Show, Etrenal Sunshine, Man on the Moon, the Majestic, and more.

The Mask was '94, Liar Liar '97, Bruce Almighty '03, and Yes Man '08. If he would have made Yes Man after Ace Ventura, The Mask, and Dumb and Dumber, then there could be an argument about it being the weakest of a set of consecutive movies. 

I do agree with the lack of chemistry, but don't think it had anything to do with Jim Carey. Like another commentor said, Zooey didn't really seem to be a good fit for her role. She actually could have been great for the male lead if it was written for a woman though.",t3_jzywv0

I agree with OP that this is an underrated movie and I think the themes in it are much deeper than most expect because of Jim Carrey and how goofy the rest of the movie is. I don't disagree with the slightly empty feeling of their relationship but I also think one of the themes of the movie most people miss is at the beginning, Carl has no conviction, nothing to live for, and the entire movie is life showing him examples of things to live for. 

Even when he's giving out loans to all the small businesses, he's meeting all of these people that are HAPPY about what they have going on, which Carl had zero experience with until now.",t3_jzywv0

142,g8la87j,t3_j9qshe,"I had been wanting to see this for a while. My boyfriend and I decided to have a casual date night and watch a movie, specifically a comedy. I knew this was going to be a dark comedy, but I didn't expect it to be so heavy and sad... so not the best movie for a lighthearted date night, but it is certainly a great movie.",t3_j9qshe
143,g8ld9kd,t3_j9qshe,one of my favorite movies hands down. i saw it 4 times when it was in theatres it’s brilliant!!,t3_j9qshe
144,g8lm5yn,t3_j9qshe,This movie was an amazing roller coaster ride. I was laughing and crying. And my heart also broke during the scene in the square. I tear up just thinking about it.,t3_j9qshe
145,g8m3w9x,t3_j9qshe,"God, that movie is so bloody great and so genuinely funny but it broke my heart into a million pieces especially when >!Jojo finds his mother hanging!< and I’m man enough to admit that during that scene, I genuinely wept.",t3_j9qshe
146,g8la0ct,t3_j9qshe,"Good movie, but imo his best work is Hunt for the Wilderpeople. One of the best movies in the last 10 years imo",t3_j9qshe
147,g8lsv7j,t3_j9qshe,I have been meaning to watch since it came out maybe now I will :),t3_j9qshe
148,g8lw125,t3_j9qshe,Have you watched Boy? I liked Jojo Rabbit but Boy is even better.,t3_j9qshe
149,g8n90qo,t3_j9qshe,"I couldn't watch past the square scene. I know it's supposed to all be a part of a message and a lot of it is tongue in cheek, but the scene as it pans up from the shoes killed me. Honestly, idk if I've seen anything in a movie outside of when little foots mom dies that has made me feel such instant anguish for some fake characters.",t3_j9qshe
150,g8o1kq7,t3_j9qshe,I love Taika Waititi he’s crazy talented and never disappoints,t3_j9qshe
151,g8mruqr,t3_j9qshe,I’m in the minority when I say I didn’t care for it. Too pandering and overly simple.,t3_j9qshe
152,g8mowk0,t3_j9qshe,"Totally! It’s hilarious, sad, shocking.. all in one. I’d highly recommend it too!",t3_j9qshe
153,g8o725l,t3_j9qshe,Can people blanking out the words write in code or backwards or something? It’s killing me.,t3_j9qshe
154,g8ojyo1,t3_j9qshe,"I especially love the windows shown after the scene at the square. Out of context, it would have seemed childishly silly, yet somehow added to the emotion of the sequence. That was unexpected!",t3_j9qshe
155,gimy1yj,t3_j9qshe,"Yeah haven’t seen a movie that was able to blend comedy into World War II while also being able to portray the tragedy of it as well as it aside from Life is beautiful. But the absurdity just allows the heavy the moments to keep their pungency. 

While some people have felt that it doesn’t go into enough of the darkness or explore the darker ideas in a meaningful enough way, (to which I understand that sentiment) I feel that such a thing would have detracted from its depiction of ludicrous nature of war, and the malleability of a child’s perception of the world, and am glad the movie didn’t try to be something it’s not in an attempt of following what other films have already displayed. It is really it’s own thing and that’s what makes it great. Even with its very Wes Anderson like humor it still carved out a very clear identity for itself.",t3_j9qshe
156,goa35bq,t3_j9qshe,"If you love Taika Waititi, check out The Hunt For the Wilderpeople. It’s super funny and just a wonderful storyline - plus of course Taika directs and has a small cameo role.",t3_j9qshe
157,g8mo5ix,t3_j9qshe,I liked it but I feel like the hitler scenes were a bit too silly if I must critique it,t3_j9qshe
158,g8my30r,t3_j9qshe,Pretty sure I suggested it not long after it came out,t3_j9qshe
159,g8ls19n,t1_g8lc7nd,"Can you remind me what this detail was, in spoiler text?",t3_j9qshe
160,g8mwqqz,t1_g8la87j,"Same here. My GF and I watched it. Me thinking the same, it's a comedy, looks fun, GF will like it, Taika Waititi, etc. But it made our hearts drop >!with that scene (showing the mother's shoes).!<

Definitely a good movie..",t3_j9qshe
161,g8rcb45,t1_g8ld9kd,I’m not sure I could emotionally handle this movie four times.,t3_j9qshe
162,g8m3uf0,t1_g8lm5yn,"I watched this at the beginning of the year on an airplane. I missed it in theaters and it was like $19.99 to rent on Prime at the time, so when I saw the opportunity to watch it for free I was all about that.

However, I quickly learned this is not the best movie to watch in a middle seat for myriad reasons...including trying hard not to visibly tear up during that scene, and then totally smile crying the last 10 minutes.",t3_j9qshe
163,g8lcjxz,t1_g8la0ct,I always find myself going back to BOY,t3_j9qshe
164,g8lcabq,t1_g8la0ct,Agreed. If you've seen his previous movies Jojo kind of had less impact because his older ones were brilliant.,t3_j9qshe
165,g8m5m3e,t1_g8lsv7j,Do it!:),t3_j9qshe
166,g8m5nbd,t1_g8lw125,I haven’t! I’m on it.,t3_j9qshe
167,g8o2ekc,t1_g8mruqr,I agree wholeheartedly.,t3_j9qshe
168,g8vnrg9,t1_g8mruqr,About how I felt. I don't totally dislike it though,t3_j9qshe
169,g8o00sw,t1_g8mo5ix,"Well ,I feel like the whimsical portrayal was sort of complementary  as we see the whole thing in a super-innocent kid's perspective;the hitler we see is after all  a figment of his imagination-whimsical,yet toxic.",t3_j9qshe

175,g8myuc3,t1_g8lcjxz,Is it a comedy? I love the rest of his movies,t3_j9qshe
176,g8lg1di,t1_g8lcjxz,I watched Boy for the first time this year and I've already rewatched it like 5 or 6 times. Definitely my new favourite film,t3_j9qshe
177,g8ldp5u,t1_g8lcabq,"I haven’t seen Boy yet, but I’ve seen the others and while I love those as well, Jojo Rabbit is actually my favourite of his so I don’t quite agree there with you",t3_j9qshe

179,g8o04lu,t1_g8o00sw,"yeah, I get what they're going for but I felt like it could've done without the goofy hitler scenes. they didn't seem to fit thematically. granted I can't properly express myself bc I have no idea the terminology and this is just my opinion. and again, I *did* like the movie",t3_j9qshe

182,g8n8zv2,t1_g8myuc3,I would say it fits into the happy-sad category that many of his other films do,t3_j9qshe
183,g8lgnxb,t1_g8ldp5u,"Possibly I felt less connected to Jojo for some reason. I guess I feel like I’m going to forget Jojo in a few years, whereas his previous films always felt like they were coming from a more personal place. Might be because he actually didn’t write Jojo himself, perhaps,and it wasn’t his own material.",t3_j9qshe
184,g8ody2p,t1_g8o04lu,"In my opinion it works well, he was pushed as a hero to these people and especially young impressionable children. It’s showing the propaganda of the time, but that slowly gets broken down as he finds out more and more for himself.",t3_j9qshe
185,g8oh9wz,t1_g8n8zv2,"Ah yes, fair.",t3_j9qshe
186,g8lnayp,t1_g8lgnxb,"Sure that might be possible but I mean for me all of his films are really unique, and for me Jojo just had that perfect mix of comedy and emotion, with fantastic performances all around. Now I am incredibly excited about Next Goal Wins (even tho we have barely heard anything about it), because I ofc love Taika and I also love football so it should be great",t3_j9qshe
187,g8lpoc6,t1_g8lnayp,"Hmm, maybe I've just seen a lot of Holocaust films and Jojo just didn't strike me as terribly interesting for that reason. In any case, glad to hear he's got another project. :)",t3_j9qshe
188,g8ls1bv,t1_g8lpoc6,I thought it was such a unique film about the holocaust tho going the satirical route with the perspective of a brainwashed child. But yea Next Goal Wins was supposed to come out this year but the pandemic happened and now I haven’t heart anything else,t3_j9qshe
189,gx5gme3,t3_n66s54,That's my movie for tonight,t3_n66s54
190,gx5l0ej,t3_n66s54,Really enjoyed it. Had several emotional moments throughout the film.,t3_n66s54
191,gx5sr4f,t3_n66s54,"I need to go off, this movie was something else. Ignore me if you want.

I loved every single thing about this movie. When I first saw this in my Netflix feed, I thought nothing of it. I never heard about the movie before I saw it. No news of it and I never even saw any reviews of it. I immediately thought it was something like Wonderpark or the Emoji Movie or Ugly Dolls. I immediately passed it off until someone on here praised it. I looked it up on IMDB and RT and it had great reviews. I just finished and after writing this, I am immediately gonna rewatch it.

I connected with this movie. It parallels my life so much right now. Katie, a film loving teenage girl who struggles to connect with her dad is excited to go to University soon to be with people who are exactly like her. She has a little brother who is hilarious and a mum who is embarrassing yet caring and loving. Not to mention the dumb dog.

Change her to male and we're the same character, thats basically my life right now. I have a hilarious little brother who is a great friend. A dumb dog who I love to bits. Two caring parents who sometimes, I struggle to connect with. A character who is going to university to study their passion. I'm off to Uni in September. Not to study film but it almost was what I was taking actually. I just connected with this so much and there were moments where I got teary eyes.

This movie is hilarious. Every joke lands and none of them feel forced. They feel organic and they fit the overall tone and aesthetic of the movie. The gags in the background fit the movie so well and I always had a smile on my face watching it. 

The animation, dear god the animation was gorgeous. Its battling with a Silent Voice right now for best looking animation right now and I think it might win. The lighting, the settings, the character design, everything about how it looked was incredible. 

Another thing about the jokes is that I think it really handled Internet jokes and Gen Z jokes so so so well. In movies like Ralph Breaks the Internet or the Emoji Movie failed to this because they focused on using the Internet and memes as the concept of the story and it feels forced. With this movie, it felt organic and funny because it wasn't the focus. The focus was on the family which was right.

The story is fun, the robots were great, the villain was fun, not to be taken seriously but a good villain I think.

I am giving this movie a A+, 10/10, 5 Stars, whatever. I loved this movie to pieces.",t3_n66s54
192,gx5lszn,t3_n66s54,"I’d been looking forward to it for about a year and yeah, I really loved it. Not sure if you’re aware, but it was done by Sony Animation who also did *Spider-Verse*, so that’s a huge reason for the similarities you see (*Into the Spider-Verse* writer/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller were also producers on *Mitchells vs The Machines*).",t3_n66s54
193,gx5lhz5,t3_n66s54,"Watched it by chance the other day. The animation is amazing and it's not a bad story, either.",t3_n66s54
194,gx5b2sa,t3_n66s54,"For me, it was way too visually overloaded. I couldn't enjoy it and by the end it was almost exhausting to finish watching the movie.",t3_n66s54
195,gx64akp,t3_n66s54,"We'll give it a shot... thanks for the suggestion. Keep posting suggestions for ""family friendly"" movies. Greatly appreciated.",t3_n66s54
196,gx66y2y,t3_n66s54,"added to the list already, will watch it with my wife this weekend.",t3_n66s54
197,gxzqo7u,t3_n66s54,"God it was amazing. I originally watched it for the queer coded character Katie, but I ended up loving the dysfunctional family trope.  My younger sister ended up loving it too and she sees herself in the younger brother. 

For a kids movie, it was equally entertaining for everyone between the robots, the dumb dog, the funny references, family moments, and jokes.

10/10, likely one of my new favorites!",t3_n66s54
198,h0viz2l,t3_n66s54,"pretty great movie, animation and characters were superb, physics were kinda thrown out the window but I completely forgot about it. Also, great representation of the LGBTQ community, and no use of sibling rivalry to make a good story. 

9.9/10",t3_n66s54
199,gx5xe02,t3_n66s54,Best film of 2021 so far and that’s a hill I’m willing to die on,t3_n66s54

201,gx6y8ik,t3_n66s54,"I don't want to shitpost but that movie was garbage.  Storyline was unimaginative,  voice actors were trash but with such a lame script,  it would be hard to be committed to any role in that movie.",t3_n66s54
202,gx5g1ve,t3_n66s54,"I loved it. I cried many times, maybe ugly cried at times. But I loved the family’s dynamic. The animation was what drew me in but the family was what kept me watching.",t3_n66s54
203,gx7zstr,t3_n66s54,I thought the unique things about it were great. But the age demographic was just a bit too low for me :-(,t3_n66s54
204,gx70vsv,t3_n66s54,This was actually a nice surprise. The film came out of nowhere and it’s like speaking with the current generation with the filter jokes and what not. Great film for sure.,t3_n66s54
205,gx6hxv5,t3_n66s54,yeah I loved it,t3_n66s54
206,gx8c9j8,t3_n66s54,This movie absolutely sucked ass. Horrible.,t3_n66s54
207,gx83zhf,t3_n66s54,"It can also get really personal tbh, great movie",t3_n66s54
208,gx89mui,t3_n66s54,I cracked up so much watching this! My kids loved it too and I never cringed at anything said or done. It was magnificent!,t3_n66s54
209,gx8myqp,t3_n66s54,I second this opinion. It was great fun.,t3_n66s54
210,gx8unsw,t3_n66s54,"Great animation and some fantastic gags, was just too overly sentimental on too many occasions. Could have picked its moments a bit better and not saturated us with it.",t3_n66s54
211,gx8xldf,t3_n66s54,"I saw that a couple of days ago. It's fun. Lord/Miller animated movies are dope. But Katie's sexuality reveal was something I wasn't expecting. Although, Olivia Colman's voice role was awesome!",t3_n66s54
212,gxascz3,t3_n66s54,"One thing I see no one talking about is the failed attempt at connecting with young people, there are many moments which reminded me of brands trying to make memes.

Other than that I really liked it and behind all the pandering to the young audience and failing horribly cringe, is a sweet movie with the occasional hilarious joke. (Maybe you could call it satire and they actually tried to imitate young people pandering cringe but it doesn't come across as that and even if it was satire it still spoils many moments)

I don't know the age range here but if you're not familiar with meme culture there's nothing noticably bad about this movie

also the ""hey I'm artsy, I'm so quirky, I don't fit in"" bs is very cringey at times but ignorable, it was most noticable at the start of the movie but once you get over that hill and ignore the awful pandering here and there it's really good, it imitates a relatively normal family with exaggerated quirks pretty well and the family conversations seemed authentic aswell.

Edit: forgot to talk about the art, it's nice, it has edits over some scenes that make it seem like katie's editing the whole thing, it's very vibrant and bright, and the action is decent. Might be sensory overload for some though.

Edit 2: keep forgetting things, robot thing doesn't make sense at all, bunch of plot holes so you shouldn't watch it if you're looking for a good human extinction or robot overtake the earth movie",t3_n66s54
213,gxdtrx6,t3_n66s54,"I enjoyed the bulk of the cast, but whoever did the voice for the little brother swung and missed big time. It was like a 30 year olds voice in a preteen.",t3_n66s54
214,gz7s6gb,t3_n66s54,I lost my dad to COVID-19 exactly a month ago... I watched the movie and oh boy it was an emotional rollercoaster with all the dad-daughter relationship thingies. Great movie.,t3_n66s54
215,gx7p7id,t3_n66s54,Truly a rare gem on Netflix.,t3_n66s54

But whether you think they're so similar that they're related, or like me and feel BS was actually too derivative, or whether you're on the side of the fence that feels they're entirely separate and each should be judged on its own merits, I still feel Superbad is the better film any way you slice it.",t3_fn3enn

The Racers

These hit at least 50% of the mark. With the assumption that one giant movie long race is, at least, equivalent to 5 races. Comedy and Tragedy are subjective. ""Step-Brothers"" is tragic and ""Requiem for a Dream"" is comedic to me, so I left that up to you. All of these films suffer from the stupid trope of ""woman loves wrong man until she doesn't,"" as you requested. The cinematography was unique for it's time and if you don't know the difference you should feel ashamed. As customary for the time period of early 50's films about the late 40's, the man is atrociously old while the woman is disgustingly young, as requested. I abhor violence, so, personally, I found these films revoltingly violent. All sorts of crashes and loud noises, it's terribly indulgent, as requested.

Lastly, these films are RIPE with symbolism. I could go on for hours about the whip pans and low angle symbolism apparent in every last one of these films. If you can't fathom the hidden McCarthyist commentary in these films as they skirt and subvert the Hays code, then I don't know what you are watching.",t3_cpdn9p

435,ewp7ij7,t1_ewp2zl4,"(Spoilers abound past this point) I can't speak for that guy but for me Hereditary was kinda ruined by its ending. Throughout the early parts of the film Ari Aster did this incredible job of building suspense and this sense of impending dread. This came to an incredible climax with the daughters death and the families reaction to it. I wholeheartedly believe that Ari Aster genuinely conveys grief and horror better than any other director out there right now (superbly demonstrated in Midsomer). My core issue with Hereditary was that these well seeded themes of guilt, grief, the struggle of raising and caring for someone with disabilities and the impact of that on families were ruined by a 'plot twist' ending that at no point been alluded to or foreshadowed and that arguably abandoned a number of the aforementioned themes that made the rest of the film so emotional and impactful. 

Now by comparison Aster's latest film 'Midsomer' has clearly learned from this and it's ending is a logical conclusion of the themes and lessons that the movie had built itself on. And that's how you create a good movie. 

That's my two cents at least.",t3_cpdn9p

I absolutely think that Collette's rendition of a mother dealing with extreme loss and her mental issues, she should have gotten the Oscar. It was an incredible performance.

My only gripe is a few moments that are a bit too topical and idk how those will age...granted the reality of immigrants is the same and on a cycle. If it was a bit more of a period piece maybe that would have helped. 

I think it's definitely not a classic whodunnit but breaks the rules in ways that make you question your basic assumption. 

If you ""guessed who the killer was"" really early on and feel that's a bad thing...it was obvious. The fact it was so obvious was why everyone writes it off. If you stuck to your guns you are either ignorant of the core tropes that drove the movie or stubborn....but more importantly...it's not about that...it's about what that means in the narrative.

507,fwv49o4,t1_fwenib0,"Idk, it depends on how specifically you are ruled by your ""taste""...it's one thing to ""not like country music""...it's another to just outright not understand the entire genre and find it bad because it doesn't make sense to you or it socially benefits you to not enjoy it, you can not like 1 thing for specific reasons...but if you can't say why you are just ignorant...same goes for movies. I think taste is merely what you have been primed to enjoy...not some kind of ""born with it"" reality. Taste is merely the limits of what you are socially and mentally able to allow yourself to enjoy. I think you can find something to like in everything that people enjoy, you just need to spend the time and brain power to figure out what IS the draw and how it might enhance your life. Expanding your taste is part of growing up. 

Outside of physical disability or different genetic makeup, in the case of cilantro tasting like soap to some people...I find taste is learned, and therefor a choice...it's one thing to ""not have gotten to something"" and another to ""not like something"" outright and not even attempt to understand it. 

I didn't GET Indian Classical music, I found it annoying, wild, and grating...until I found it in the right context, with the right state of mind and a knowledge of its background...and now I love it...no different for Whodunnit's vs War movies...etc. I just think outright distaste for something is just a reflection of a lack of lived experience with that thing or a lack of understanding for what value that thing is actually meant to provide. If you don't understand what it is offering you will reject it...accepting that rejection as anything more than a hurdle to get over is, imo, a childish habit to grow out of.",t3_hi11k6

> The film contains several references to old Scandinavian folklore. For example, the goats on a bridge and a troll under it are a reference to the ""Three Billy Goats Gruff"". At one point Kalle mentions an eating competition, a reference to the story ""Askeladden"". 

and 

> Trollhunter contains many references to Norwegian culture and Norwegian folktales e.g. the belief that there are different species of trolls, trolls having a tail, multiple heads, the ability to smell a Christian's blood, trolls eating rocks, but loving meat and sometimes being man-eaters. The trolls are also described as big, old, strong, but slow and dim-witted, turning to stone when exposed to sunlight.

Not to take away from Trent Reznor's and Atticus Ross' accomplishments elsewhere, but John Powell's work is so clearly supperior, as a standalone musical composition AND as a film score, to what Reznor/Ross did... Ugh. To this day I feel Powell was robbed.

There's also stuff about WWII and atomic bombs that feed into the narrative despite it taking place in a rural town.

It’s not comparable to something like Threads or The Road etc. It’s a lot to do with the perspective you’re given, The House That Jack Built didn’t really allow you to feel much sympathy towards the victims, it didn’t allow you to become attached to the people suffering so it wasn’t really that sad.",t3_lyzh7y

947,fkyyq2s,t3_flj7ad,"**Coming of Age: 20th Century Women**

It's the perfect coming of age movie. Its about a boy and his single mother (Annette Benning), and the mother asks people that she knows to help raise him because he doesnt have a father. Those people include Greta Gerwig, who rents a room in their house. Also, Elle Fanning, the boys best friend, and Billy Crudup, who also rents a room. 

It's great because it tells the story of all those 4 characters as well as the main boy. The interactions and dialogue between the characters is so good and authentic. And the overall story goes over each characters entire life and its just so good and emotional and insightful and funny and comforting lmao and the soundtrack is SO GOOD.

Edit: also a fantastic element of it is that because it focuses on both male and female characters in such an in depth way, there's always someone you can relate to (because I've found that some coming of age movies that focus on one specific person can be alienating – for example lots of men said they didnt relate to the relationship dynamics in Lady Bird, etc)",t3_flj7ad

961,fkzcvua,t3_flj7ad,"tough to say for me since my favourite movie of a genre isn't always the greatest/best of the genre for me when looking at it more objectively, and they also aren't always the most quintessential films of the genre either. But imo for the movies that offer a balance of greatness, how well they epitomise/capture the spirit of the genre and the overall quality I feel the movies have, I'd say..

* Action: Terminator 2.  Die Hard is probably second place, but the smaller feel of that movie compared to the bombastic action-packed nature of T2 is what fueled my decision here.
* Gangster: The Godfather. Goodfellas would have to be second place, but even then those two offer two different sides of the gangster coin. I feel Godfather wins for its influence, how it was first and how it drips with the feel of the mob in every scene whereas Goodfellas leans slightly more towards the 'crime' genre imo with how it takes a more casual tone.
* Sci-Fi: 2001 - A Space Odyssey.
* Fantasy: Lord of the Rings. honourable mention to Star Wars, which blends fantasy,sci-fi,adventure, etc in a way that makes it hard to pin down in one genre - despite being a classic film.
* Legal Drama: A Few Good Men
* Erotic Thriller: Basic instinct.
* Mockumentary: This is Spinal Tap. pretty much the citizen kane of documentaries.
* Tech Noir: Blade Runner
* Cyberpunk Cinema: The Matrix
* Neo-Noir: Chinatown or Se7en. I'm really torn between the progenitor in Chinatown which epitomises the genre more, and one of my all time favourites with Se7en which I feel marks the peak of the genre quality-wise.
* Body Horror: Videodrome
* Psychological Horror: The Shining (even though Black Swan is probably my favourite of the genre, personally.)
* Sports Movie: Rocky. had to be Rocky.
* Buddy Cop: Lethal Weapon.
* LGBT Cinema: Batman & Robin",t3_flj7ad

* Drama: *The Intouchables (2011)*  
The characters, relationships, acting are just so perfect. Beautiful story and incredibly well told. (It is subtitled, but that shouldn’t stop you from seeing it.)
* Crime: *Fracture (2007)*  
One of my absolute favourite courtroom thrillers. Surprising it isn’t more well-known since it stars Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.
* Romance: *The Village (2004)*  
It was mismarketed, as it kinda sucks as a thriller/horror. But it’s one of the most beautiful romances ever filmed. James Newton Howard’s score, and the porch scene? Perfection.
* Sci-Fi: *Contact (1997)*  
This one’s probably not as underappreciated, but it’s not necessarily the one that comes to mind first with all the modern sci-fis out there.
* Romantic Comedy: *The Lady Eve (1941)*  
I really need to watch this one again, but I remember thinking it was the perfect romantic comedy the first time I saw it. Barbara Stanwyck is gold.
* Dark Comedy: *Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)*  
Need to watch this one again too, but I remember being shocked at the wonderful dark humor in this classic black and white film.

1009,fl1gr8x,t3_flj7ad,"Slice of Life: American Beauty - This is the most 'human' film on the whole list and really fleshes out concerns and fears that many people experience on the daily basis and how very well done characters cope with these and try to find peace, or fall into ruin. So many moments where I was like, 'Wow, I've felt that' or thinking words of encouragement to the actors on screen because I connected with them, I felt for them and I wanted them to do well. Add some twists, an all-star cast and dark comedy? Count me in for one of my all time favorites on this one.


Revenge Flick: Oldboy (Korean Version) - Currently my favorite movie. It has a plot that makes you think about uncomfortable topics in a weird light and a few twists that really cut deep into how you understand the film, the acting is phenomenal, comedy is well done, action is well choreographed and it really ties it all together pretty well. Even the American remake with Josh Brolin is good, it is also a highly recommended film.


Cerebral: Donnie Darko - This movie explores concepts like predeterminism and life purpose in a way I haven't seen in anything but 'American Beauty' and throws a dark, sometimes horrifying, shroud over it.


Cheesy Action Comedy: Army of Darkness - Bruce Campbell's masterpiece. A man with a chainsaw hand and a bad attitude is thrown into the past, where magic is real, and given a quest to destroy the ultimate evil and save the world (And the girl of course).


Sci-Fi/Apocalyptic: The Fifth Element - So many  concepts, so much funny, so much action and just so much Bruce Willis goodness just kicking ass and saving everyone. Good job Bruce.


Fantasy: Willow -  A small farmer/apprentice magician, meets Madmartigan, a great swordsman, and together they journey through a war-torn land of magic and monsters, to save a baby princess from death at the hands of an evil queen


Coming of Age: Simon Birch - A boy with a physical handicap lives life to its fullest and becomes someone worthy of admiration. Full of raunchy comedy and honestly one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. Marley and Me doesn't even touch it.

Crime Caper: The Departed - An all-star cast to fill out a riveting plot where no one is safe and everyone is out for themselves.


Superhero: The Watchmen - A group of super humans portrayed with a somewhat realistic view of how they would be treated in modern day life. Also cause I love Rorschrach.


Serial Killer: Seven - Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt get too close to a case about a string of murders based around the seven deadly sins.",t3_flj7ad

Slapstick films are comedy films where physical comedy that includes pratfalls, tripping, falling, practical jokes, mistakes, are highlighted over dialogue, plot and character development. The physical comedy in these films contains a cartoonish style of violence that is predominantly harmless and goofy in tone.

1101,flg0kh0,t1_fkzrakx,"I would beg to differ. The movie is based on heavy literary research and weaves together different aspects of sailor folklore with tales from Greek mythology. It marries parts of the Promethean story with that of Proteus and the dialogue is much like that of Herman Melville's writing which also took some biblical stories and reinterpreted aspects of them (Captain Ahab's rage is like King Ahab of the bible who is related by some to the AntiChrist and Willem Dafoe's character appears to share some traits with this archetype). 

It is unfortunate, but very few people read the classics nowadays. Few people are familiarized with Greek mythology, or the Bible, or even nineteenth-century literature which might otherwise make this film an awesome reinterpretation of many classical stories. 

There are some universally relatable themes in the film like the greenhorn being subjected to arbitrary menial tasks in order to curry favor with the master or sage who resistant and unwilling to put up with his underling's naivete. If however, you understand the transgressions of the apprentice in terms of their mythological subtext, like the act of Prometheus who defies Zeus (I won't spoil any of the film for those who have not seen it), so much more of the film makes sense and it is made all the more enjoyable.",t3_flj7ad

There is a line from Manny the corpse about wondering what else Hank could be hiding from him (aside from his farts) and why that thought makes him feel so alone.  It's also fun to see what Hank chooses to teach Manny about life. I wonder what topics I'd cover if I had to teach a corpse about what the world is like?

Another interesting moment: when the two >!end up in Sarah's backyard, and Manny farts and  gets a boner in front of Sarah's kid. It's gross until I remember that to Manny, this is a quick and honest way to assure the kid that he's a human being. It's kind of crushing seeing Manny realize that people think he ought to be ashamed of himself. Even more so when I think about how many times people have those moments as they grow up.!<

The funniest part of the movie for me is when Manny and Hank are on the bus in the woods. The farting and boner humor definitely loses its gilt (if it ever had any) super fast in terms of being funny, but I definitely see why it was ultimately important to the movie!",t3_knj4zk

1136,ghmasnd,t1_ghl3n4o,When I saw this in the cinema 4 people walked out after THAT opening scene. They don’t know what they’re missing!,t3_knj4zk
1137,g3frgti,t3_ijqa19,"Criminally underrated movie. The only criticism was how many times you hear “Andrew”, but even that was understandable. They should have developed the universe and made sequels.",t3_ijqa19
1138,g3frjza,t3_ijqa19,I went to the theaters one day and chose this randomly without knowing anything about it. Best movie discovery ever,t3_ijqa19
1139,g3fqqlb,t3_ijqa19,"I was just thinking about this movie today. I saw it in theaters back when it came out. It definitely filled me with fanfare. The friend I was with and I started geeking out on super hero flicks afterward.

More specifically, I was recalling the scene where the !
>!crazy kid rips teeth right out of that bully’s mouth. And how he was trying to describe it like “forming little lassos with his mind.” !< It was compelling ‘super hero movie dialogue’ I think it was a fresh take on the “coming into great power” theme. 

I think it has been very influential on the entire super hero movie genre. Movies like the Power Rangers reboot, Brightburn, or Midnight Special. Not only would I recommend this movie, but happily start watching it right now if I could stream it as well",t3_ijqa19
1140,g3fvp2z,t3_ijqa19,What a great movie! I recently watched Akira from 1988 and it reminded me a lot to Chronicle. I believe it was its inspiration and it's definitely awesome as well.,t3_ijqa19
1141,g3fsk2f,t3_ijqa19,Loved dane dehaan in this 👌,t3_ijqa19
1142,g3g4ti2,t3_ijqa19,I showed this movie to my friends and they all hated It and told me it was bad so fuck them and now you are all my friends <3,t3_ijqa19
1143,g3gbk46,t3_ijqa19,Project Almanac is another one with the same feel.,t3_ijqa19
1144,g3fts5m,t3_ijqa19,"Great movie! Stumbled upon it on Netflix a couple months back. Couldn't recognise Michael B Jordan in this movie haha , he grew way bigger.",t3_ijqa19
1145,g3fwj2q,t3_ijqa19,I actually enjoyed this film.This film showed what will happen to you if you are given superpowered.,t3_ijqa19

1148,g3fovcy,t3_ijqa19,This movie was really great and it really messed with my head.,t3_ijqa19
1149,g3ftzfe,t3_ijqa19,The first time I noticed Michael B Jordan!   Also just a great premise.,t3_ijqa19
1150,g3g9b1p,t3_ijqa19,Thanks for the recommendation. Adding it to my watch list.,t3_ijqa19
1151,g3g830z,t3_ijqa19,I love that movie,t3_ijqa19
1152,g3gee8l,t3_ijqa19,One of my favorite movies,t3_ijqa19
1153,g3grh1v,t3_ijqa19,"If you think Dane DeHaan gets very creepy in this, see The Stranger on Quibi. It's another dark role for him.",t3_ijqa19
1154,g3hcflz,t3_ijqa19,"I have to disagree.  It's a terrible usage of found footage.  As often happens with this type, the director is unwilling to work within the format's limitations and has all angles covered, including in the final confrontation.  If he had faith in his story, he should have made it a regular omniscient perspective film and not found footage.",t3_ijqa19
1155,g3i3zet,t3_ijqa19,"Really good, fun, interesting film. Saw it twice in the theatre.",t3_ijqa19
1156,g3i4cj8,t3_ijqa19,I always mix this up with Project Almanac but I think Chronicle is better and I usually hate found footage movies ..highly recommend! I think it’s a great rainy day movie,t3_ijqa19
1157,g3i7c6f,t3_ijqa19,"Thank you for suggesting this,  just watched it and thought it was great. 

>!A much truer depiction of how I think most people would behave if suddenly endowed with super powers, vs what we usually see from Hollywood.!<

>!I did think the found footage aspect felt a bit forced, particularly towards the end but still a great movie overall. !<",t3_ijqa19
1158,g4b54u3,t3_ijqa19,"How did this post get so many up-votes? I remember watching Chronicle back in 2012. What I saw was an incredibly white-washed movie, yes even Michael B. Jordan was whitewashed in that movie. Boring, unfunny, low budget science fiction-wannabe movie. I didn't laugh at any of the cliche sophomoric jokes. The movie is made for 12 yr old kids and stoners, that's about it.",t3_ijqa19
1159,g3glop9,t1_g3frgti,"Did you know about the alternate ending they had originally planned? 

>Landis' original ending took a much more literal depiction of super-heroics. The original script had the film jumping ahead two years to show a dam breaking in Asia, with Matt swooping in to thunderous applause from those about to drown. He hypes the crowd even further - shouting ""F*** YEAH KOREA!"" - then uses his telekinetic powers to stop the giant wave of water.


I read somewhere that prior to this, at the end of their city battle, Matt is captured by police and wakes up in some secret hospital, heals himself somehow and breaks out. Very superhero-y. Don't know if I *prefer* it to the ending we got, but I sure do enjoy the idea of it and really wish there was more!",t3_ijqa19
1160,g3i3rq3,t1_g3frgti,Not really underrated as most people really like it lol.,t3_ijqa19
1161,g3hqe0s,t1_g3frjza,That’s a great feeling. Did that as a kid with Stargate. Was dropped off to see Quiz Show but it was sold out.,t3_ijqa19
1162,g3frr83,t1_g3fqqlb,I don't even remember that scene. I need to watch it again.,t3_ijqa19

1168,g3g22ya,t1_g3fwj2q,"Well, not everyone. The experience to have superpowers will vary from person to person depending on their upbringing and morals. Andrew just had a terrible life.",t3_ijqa19
1169,g3h571d,t1_g3glop9,"He had a sequel in mind too, but the excecs said “no we don’t you want you to develop the story, we want literalky the same as the first one” and he passed",t3_ijqa19

1178,gkohseb,t3_l46urk,"I discovered this book at an Indian reservation rest stop while traveling to British Columbia.  It was one of those pick a book/leave a book situations.  It was such a great read, and when I returned it to the book exchange on the way home, I added a note highly recommending it.  I was so excited to see the film on Netflix. As with most book to film adaptations there were some deviations, but Paul Rudd did an excellent job as the lead.  I can recommend both the film and the book.",t3_l46urk

1194,ez3ryok,t3_czwqxa,I agree. Massively underrated film.,t3_czwqxa
1195,ez4h6rd,t3_czwqxa,One of the best films based on a YA book. *That* scene still makes me cry and leaves me devastated.,t3_czwqxa

1197,ez5guv2,t3_czwqxa,I’ve always been interested but the title makes it sound too depressing. I’m not interested in watching a movie like that,t3_czwqxa

1250,gq7ilau,t1_gq75uo3,Synecdoche is not everyone's cup of tea. It's a great movie but not as easily accessible as some of Kaufman's other work.,t3_m0adeh
1251,gq774td,t1_gq75uo3,"My favorite all time movie is synecdoche. 

Adaptation is up there as well but beware relying on Kaufman. Anomolisa and In thinking of Ending Things are of a much lower quality IMO.",t3_m0adeh
1252,gqav10e,t1_gq8kxth,Sure sure!,t3_m0adeh
1253,gq7nsdd,t1_gq7ilau,Loved it but what a brainfuck that was.,t3_m0adeh
1254,gq7vmov,t1_gq7ilau,Will find out soon if it's for me or not.,t3_m0adeh
1255,gq85pd7,t1_gq774td,"Interesting, I find Anomalisa to be right up there with his other best work. I’m Thinking of Ending Things was a mixed bag for me, but that may be because I read the book prior to seeing it. 

What about Anomalisa makes it of lower standing in your opinion? Just curious.",t3_m0adeh
1256,gq7qxzl,t1_gq774td,I haven't watched Anomalisa yet but I really enjoyed the confusing developing and message of Ending Things (alongside a wonderful Jesse Buckley imho).. do you think I should check Anomalisa still?,t3_m0adeh
1257,gq79x8v,t1_gq774td,"I felt the same about Anomalisa, which was my introduction to Kaufman. And I'm not really feeling like watching I'm thinking of  ending things. But really excited about the other two movies!",t3_m0adeh
1258,gq87u5m,t1_gq85pd7,"I loved Anomolisa. I did. But it was a flat story that I haven't found the desire to watch again. It just wasn't as profoundly interesting as Adaptation, Synecdoche, John Malkovich, or Eternal Sunshine. 

The stop motion was excellent and I love Tom Noonan. I watched it, I enjoyed it, I haven't thought about it since. 

I also read Ian Reid's novel and thought it to be pretty bad. It just took some old, used themes and rehashed them into a bad book with the laziest of endings. When I heard Kaufman was going to make a film adaptation, I couldn't understand why. Then I saw his adaptation and I still didn't understand why.


Did you read Antkind?",t3_m0adeh
1259,gq8608c,t1_gq7qxzl,"There were a lot of great things involved in Ending Things but I read the book by Ian Reid and HATED it. It may have tainted my viewing of the film. The 'twist' was obvious from like page 30 on, and was still presented as if it was this amazing reveal.

I also read Charlie Kaufman's 700 page novel, Antkind, this year. It was fun at times but mostly it wasn't fun and made no sense and was about 650 pages too long. I can't recommend it to anyone.",t3_m0adeh
1260,gq88k6v,t1_gq7qxzl,"Sorry, I was so busy ranting I forgot to answer your question. Yes! You should watch Anomolisa! It is worth your time. It just kinda marks a turning point in Kaufman's career where I begin to enjoy him less.

I think reading his book traumatized me. It was a HUGE waste of time. IMHO.",t3_m0adeh
1261,gqa0skw,t1_gq87u5m,"Yeah I actually enjoyed ITOET the book. I understand it wasn’t ground breaking or anything, but I really liked the atmosphere of dread. I enjoyed aspects of the film, but it was hard for me to separate how I felt about the book from it and I ended up kind of confused.

Yes I did read Antkind. To be honest, I had some trouble getting through it, but did finish it. The narrative was just so meandering and absurd. I will say though, what a hilarious book. I don’t think I would’ve gotten through it without the laughs. I actually woke up my ex girlfriend multiple times because I was shaking the bed from laughing so hard. Did you read it and what did you think?",t3_m0adeh
1262,gq8hjh6,t1_gq88k6v,"ahahaha no worries, thanks for the insight!",t3_m0adeh
1263,gqa63vw,t1_gqa0skw,"I did read it and felt the same way. Lots of laughs, but overall I felt it was plainly obnoxious. There were too many compelling storylines completely abandoned just as they were catching speed and although I can enjoy reading books where I dislike the main character/narrator, but there was just too much rambling about nothing. I can usually read a book this size in a week or so but Antkind took me like three months. I think it is a book that was produced with the intention that second and third readings would be vastly more satisfying than the first, but I doubt I'll ever pick up that book ever again.

I may have been too rough on my criticism of IToET, the novel. It's pacing was great and had many fun elements of horror. I just feel that the specific overused 'twist' towards the end left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Also, I have to bring up the fact that Kaufman himself makes fun of that exact brand of 'twist' in Adaptation (the theme of his twin brother's screenplay, The Three) and he mentions it again in Antkind several times, referring to it's use as lazy in both inclusions. I only now remembered this. Maybe he's making some kind of majorly meta joke that blew over my head.",t3_m0adeh
1264,gqacexj,t1_gqa63vw,"Yeah I feel very much the same about Antkind. I think it probably would reward repeat reads, but damn am I not ready to even think about doing that. Maybe if it was like half the length. I feel the same thing could’ve been accomplished in like 300 pages. 

People are very split down the middle on the ITOET twist. For me, I didn’t like the twist necessarily, but I also didn’t mind it. I know endings are important, but it really didn’t leave a bad taste in my mouth because I wasn’t looking for answers in the first place. The surreal horror of the journey was enough for me, so the destination/ending couldn’t have really ruined that, but I totally get why it did for some people.

Weirdly enough, Kaufman’s adaptation of ITOET and Antkind feel almost like companion pieces to me. They have a similar brand of absurdity and both comment on film criticism, art and death a lot. That kinda just sounds like every Kaufman film now that I read what I wrote lol. But he did make both things around the same time so it makes sense that they feel similar.",t3_m0adeh
1265,gqad74p,t1_gqacexj,I think you would enjoy reading House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski.,t3_m0adeh
1266,gqdzuk7,t1_gqad74p,"I was literally going to bring it up to you in my last comment. Read it last year, and it’s one of my favorite books.

I actually started a thread on the HoL sub a while back where we discussed who we thought would make a good film adaptation of it, excluding Danielewski himself. I don’t know how HoL could ever be adapted to the screen, but my answer was Kaufman, 100%. If anyone could figure it out, it’d be him.",t3_m0adeh
1267,gqel1eu,t1_gqdzuk7,"I love HoL too. Read it years ago and still think of it like once a week. I've been creeping through The Familiar by Danielewski for the past month and don't know what to think about it yet.

As far as House of Leaves film adaptations, I feel it would have to be a miniseries and my thoughts, when reading it, were always about either Darren Aronofski or David Lynch directing it. Kaufman would be great, too.

Id also like to see a ten hour 'Navidson Record' mockumentary directed by the Coen Brothers.",t3_m0adeh
1268,gqgnw24,t1_gqel1eu,"Aronofski would probably do a great job. Parts of the book gave me “Mother!” vibes, which is one of my favorite films. Lynch is also a good choice. The idea of “The Navidson Record” by the Coen Brothers sounds amazing. They do dark whimsy in a way that would serve it well.

Also, you’re obviously into weird fiction, have you read/heard of the southern reach trilogy? The first book is what that movie Annihilation is based on. I liked the film fine, had some issues with it. But when I later read the books, I fell in love. If you like cosmic horror with some weird, almost psychedelic sci-fi elements, definitely check it out.",t3_m0adeh
1269,gemarzn,t3_k6ntjw,I love this movie and Zhukov absolutely steals the show. “What’s a war hero got to do to get some lubrication around here?”,t3_k6ntjw
1270,gemaej4,t3_k6ntjw,"If you liked this movie, I would suggest you to check out - look who's back. 
It's a German satirical comedy movie about a plot which involves Hilter waking up in 21st century and interpreting modern situation from a nazi perspective. Trust me it's hilarious and scary at the same time.",t3_k6ntjw
1271,geme7sl,t3_k6ntjw,"Goodbye Lenin gave me the same vibe. It's about a woman who wakes up from a long coma and her doctor is advising the family to protect her fragile state from shocks or trauma.
The thing is, she doesn't know DDR doesn't exist anymore, so her son is doing everything he can to set up fake DDR in their apartment, since the mother can't leave the house.
It's so heartwarming and funny, I liked it so much!",t3_k6ntjw
1272,gemqmat,t3_k6ntjw,"It's absolutely brilliant. I had to pause it and do a quick wiki so I knew who everyone was, but it was SO ENGAGING, after the movie, I went down a wikihole to find out even more. Absolutely crazy times that I never heard of, bc as a kid in the 80s, all this stuff was still hidden behind the Iron Curtain.

The cult of personality was fascinating. It was like The Thick of IT but wayyyyy darker. They all just hated each other and sold each other out without a thought.

I'm pretty sure the same is happening in Trump's white house right now, excpet, like, in a much more lame and stupid way.",t3_k6ntjw
1273,gelzlu5,t3_k6ntjw,"I love the movie too and parts of it are surprisingly accurate actually .  


You have to remember Stalin was the law and he had a reputation for turning on allies and so everyone worked really hard not to cross his ire which leads to the hilarious outcomes of the movie  . What do a bunch of power hungry leeches do when a vacancy clears for the strongest man in the country and they n longer have to entertain him ?  


Great movie and while definitely parts are played up for laughs I thought it was a fun exploration into that kind of concept .  


I had to look up pictures of Zhukov to see if that number of medals was real and .. I was not disappointed LOL.",t3_k6ntjw
1274,gem9eca,t3_k6ntjw,"Love this movie, while we are talking about an Armando Iannucci movie has anyone seen THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF DAVID COPPERFIELD? It seems different than his other work.",t3_k6ntjw

Is there any other recommendation for similar political satire?",t3_k6ntjw

1279,genxowb,t3_k6ntjw,[removed],t3_k6ntjw
1280,geqqeln,t3_k6ntjw,One of my favorite movies. It was great how they all had different english accents to reflect on the different dialects in the USSR instead of faking a russian accent.,t3_k6ntjw
1281,genbkds,t3_k6ntjw,I couldn’t exactly get a grip on the film or begin to like it. Is this because of a lack of knowledge or is it perhaps not my specific humour. My friends seem to love it so I don’t understand why I don’t,t3_k6ntjw
1282,gemckta,t1_gemarzn,i like when hes letting the people choose there ak's and he like which one do you want to take on holiday but he is the best character by far then stalins son then Khrushchev,t3_k6ntjw

1287,geof3sb,t1_gemqmat,"Written by Armando Iannucci, who wrote The thick of it, which is why it's similar. It's one of those great films that never gets any recognition.",t3_k6ntjw
1288,gem0bzw,t1_gelzlu5,"know i know all of that i just don't know much about that transition of power from Stalin to Khrushchev so i just put ""i do not think"" i never said it wasn't accurate i just said i don't know",t3_k6ntjw
1289,gemn45j,t1_gem9eca,"I saw it not long ago and don’t remember much about it so I guess I’d call it “forgettable” lol. I’ve liked his more political stuff like this, in the loop, and veep.",t3_k6ntjw

1307,eflfa1j,t3_amex9d,"P.S. If you end up liking it, listen to second song in the credits! It was written by Kevin Renick for Jason Reitman, who directed the film, and really ties everything together emotionally. It's a nice touch.",t3_amex9d

1322,efmfr5c,t1_eflmxd7,"Oh there's definitely more to it, otherwise I wouldn't have suggested it. I just couldn't fit everything I wanted to say about it in the title. A lot of the comedy, like most good comedy, comes directly from how miserable and fucked up life can be at times. I guess I could have found a better word than ""genuine"" to get that across, but I feel like the term ""dark comedy"" has a certain faux edgy stigma attached to it that doesn't really fit. 
It's dark and depressing in the ways that life is often dark and depressing, and manages to draw quite a bit of laughter from these situations. It's realistic and grounded, and anything that truly fits those descriptions is inevitably going to be a little dark and depressing.

1325,efmf60t,t1_eflz46w,"That's fair. Although I don't think the ending is necessarily the most depressing part, it seemed to meat least that he had found a certain amount of peace and come to terms with the like he's chosen, but the movie certainly dives into depressive waters at several points throughout. I was just trying to say that the humor is very character driven and true to life, as opposed to lighthearted and fluffy. I still think 
""Do you ever check in on them?""
""I mean no, nothing good is going to come of that"" 
is one of the funniest exchanges of dialogue I've heard recently, despite the fact that the conversation they're having is about potential suicide. 
I guess for me the humor mostly outweighs the depression, and most of the ""sad"" scenes are peppered with truly great moments of comedy, but you are definitely right that there is a certain amount of nihlism embedded in the DNA of the story.

His other movie Boy was really cute too. It had some sad elements like HFTWP, but still that Taika style. Walter Mitty, the remake not the original from 40s or something gave me the same kind of cute/cool movie feeling.

The thing about Bret Easton Ellis and his writing is, especially with a book like American psycho, he is really good at putting you inside the head of the narrator. Having chapters that just like start and end in the middle of a sentence, I truly felt insane while I was reading it. That being said I really really appreciate Christian bale as an actor and I think he did such a good job with this character. It’s the small little details he was able to master. Like that part where he is at the laundromat screaming at the employees and his friend bumps into him trying to get him to commit to having dinner or something and he just has this great way of being “fake nice” but then as soon as he leaves the laundromat for a split second before the scene ends you can see his fake smile dissolve into that expressionless face of disgust.",t3_lq2gns

The man begins to psychologically and physically torture the couple in a series of gifts.  Beautiful cinematography. A “not sure who I’m rooting for here” kind of mindset, Captivating. Entirely realistic which I agree makes for an enjoyable horror movie for myself as well—Room and We Need to Talk about Kevin moved me significantly.

I'm quite desensitised when it comes to disturbing things as I watch a ton of horror and thriller movies etc but this movie really made me feel disturbed

It's based on the fear of nuclear war that plagued the late 20th century and follows a fictional breakout of war between the Soviet Union and the west and follows the people of Sheffield in the UK. 

It shows the effects of paranoia and post nuclear devastation in such a gritty and realistic way that it's genuinely more horrifying than any ghost or thriller movie. It's real horror and it's a threat even in today's world.

OP, scratch that one, and I'd like to suggest Starred Up instead. Now *that* is a realistic prison movie, about a violent criminal who ends up incarcerated in the same place as his estranged father.

I hear the argument for Chasing Amy being dangerously close, and it’s a classic of it’s time to some degree, but it’s just a bit too cringe for me. I liked it a lot when I saw it when I was 17 (15 years ago), but ever since then it just gets worse and worse every time.",t3_m2wa7a

1736,gm7qqy3,t3_ldicbk,"As a huge fan of the original radio series, the books, and then the brilliantly-faithful BBC adaptation, I really didn't enjoy the film. 

It wasn't terrible, it was just... fine, but for me, it lacked the (maybe British) humour and warmth of the previous work.  In common with many films, every character needs a back story, a scene explaining their ""motivation"" (e.g. Willy Wonka's dentist dad to ""explain"" why he now loved sweets and chocolate so much), or a love interest story that's not in the original. I appreciate that this may be necessary due to the time constraints of format, but I think that's what often makes a film fall flat when compared to a much-loved book. 

I can't remember specifics, as it was a long time ago, but there were so many instances where a joke from the book was set up but then they didn't deliver the punchline, or where they did do the punchline, but without the set up.

I mean OK it IS controversial and one can definitely abstain from watching or finishing the film on these grounds... But the film isn't just outright being racist it's using satire to raise questions about racism. There IS a difference... 

If one choose to shut the film off or leave because of this it says a lot more about the viewer... as them shutting it off will not magically make racism disappear. The writers are trying to use satire in order to raise a meaningful discussion / criticism about America / Americans and their forgien policy...even just the general view of Americans of anyone other (Middle Easterners, South Americans, French, Koreans etc.) The whole concept of the movie is everyone is bad and needs America's help and the naiieve protagonist try to help but inadvertently make things worse. 

It is genieus. (In their own unique way, using their medium of satire)... They aren't smart when it comes to politics and such but they sense that something isn't right and as artist they use their medium to try and make a comment here. I think the success of the film speaks for itself.

I Am Not a Serial Killer

Climax

I had seen this suggested yesterday in the horror subreddit and im a sucker for found footage style movies so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did, the movie based off the description seemed like just a typical haunted house story but with GoPros so nothing that hasn't been done before. I haven't had that same scared feeling watching a movie since I was a little kid when Blair Witch came out and I watch tons of scary movies.

[The Quiet Earth](https://www.kjasfkjhbbkl.com) (fake link to avoid spoilers) - My favorite film of all time.  *Do not read any other reviews or descriptions!!!* They all give away major plot points. Even IMDB gives away important information. All you need to know is that it is about a man who wakes up to find that everyone else has disappeared and that it was filmed and set in New Zealand in the mid-'80s. It is a phenomenal slow burn sf movie.

[A Scanner Darkly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/) - Explores drugs, the police state, and sanity in a future dystopia.  Based on the story of the same name by Philip K Dick and with an all-star cast (Keanu Reeves, Wynona Ryder, & Robert Downey Jr).

[Dark Star](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069945/) - Started out as a student film by John Carpenter, it follows a group of astronauts on a mission to blow up planets in preparation for colonists to come and colonize other planets in various systems.   Twenty years into their nearly complete mission, things start to go wrong.

[Event 16](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831289/) - Very tightly plotted time travel film with some additional twists.  The low budget shows through on occasion, but overall quite good.

[In the Shadow of the Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110640/) - Solid movie about a detective hunting down a time traveling serial killer.

[Killer Klowns from Outer Space](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095444/) - Truly excellent indie horror film.

[Nemesis](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107668/) - Underrated vintage cyberpunk film that follows a burned out cyborg cop in LA.

[Pi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/) - Darren Aronofsky directed this film that focuses on a mathematician who makes a discovery and is visited by mysterious groups. 

[Prospect](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7946422/) - A space miner and his daughter try to make one last run before the final interstellar ship departs from the area.

[Renaissance (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386741/) - Animated pulpy cyberpunk film.

[The Rocketeer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102803/) - One of the best super hero films ever.  Follows a young pilot who finds an ultra-high tech helmet that allows him to fly without a plane. 

[Screamers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/) - One of the best man vs robot/android films ever.  A true cult classic.

[Silent Running](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067756/) - Absolutely classic sci-fi about a botanist on a spaceship.

[Strange Days](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114558/) - Brilliant cyberpunk film from Kathryn Bigelow.  The plot of the film revolves around a black rapper who was shot by two cops, who then attempt to suppress the video of it.

[Virtual Revolution](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4054004/) - I have a difficult time recommending this film.  It's so close to being brilliant, but the editing fails hard (or maybe the writing failed hard and the editor patched together some semblance of a story).  It's a cyberpunk world where a huge swath of the citizens spend the vast majority of their time in a virtual world to escape the drudgery of every day life.

The puppet masters is another one - based on the Heinlein book and starring Donald Sutherland - he made quite a few B sci fi movies worth a look.

There was a day of the triffids mini series, from the 80's by the BBC to - its outstanding if you can find it.

2179,g9ee977,t3_jecslk,"You've got similar taste to me, so I'll try to help. I'll start with some anime.

- Time of Eve

A true hidden gem in my book. ""In the future, probably Japan,"" there's widespread android servants complete with Asimov's laws. Oh, and there's a special cafe. Overall fairly light hearted, but an outright tearjerker at times.

I cannot recommend it highly enough.

- Patema: Inverted

Same director as above. Not as good imo, but not bad. If you love Time of Eve you'll probably want to check it out, along with some shorts: Pale Cocoon, Harmonie, and the hilarious [Bureau of Proto Society](https://youtu.be/3ZixDy29D2Y).

- Cencoroll: Connect

A very basic anime concept. There are monsters that psychically bond with people, people fight using them. Blah blah blah.

But it's just handled really well and is a lot of fun. And it's 75 minutes so if you hate it, it'll be over soon.

- Summer Wars, Your Name, Redline, Paprika, Tekkonkinkreet, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (which I actually didn't love) etc.

Not hidden gems by any stretch, but if you're not an anime person you might have missed them. Plenty more good scifi anime movies out there.


Other non-anime things you might have missed:

- Sorry to Bother You

Directorial debut of Boots Riley, the frontman of the venerable Marxist hip-hop band, The Coup.

- Kontroll

Not scifi per se, but I think it'd be up your alley. Psychological thriller meets slacker comedy in the Budapest subway system.

- Ice Pirates

1980s scifi parody, 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, need I say more?

- Zardoz

Another wild blast from the past. Sean Connery is the uber-chad let loose to teach all those crystal worshipping virgins how to fight and fuck, or something like that. If you haven't seen it, you must at some point.

- Cypher

A fun little scifi industrial espionage psychological thriller by the director of Cube.

- Pontypool

Snow Crash meets 28 Days Later from the comfort of a rural Ontario radio studio. Probably you've seen it, but it shouldn't be missed if you haven't.

- Beyond the Black Rainbow

Directorial debut of Panos Cosmatos (Mandy). Equally trippy visuals, more subdued storytelling.",t3_jecslk

A lot of Dick’s work is alternate/futuristic world building. Blade Runner and Total Recall movies are very in tune with that but I just can’t get into the 80’s vibe they put off. The remakes feel the same as well. Idk maybe now that I’m older I should try to rewatch them.,t3_jecslk

2369,g9dyad1,t1_g9dxl9s,Oh god I have to think on this awhile. A lot of them would be Sci Fi based probably. They need an app that stores your watched movies and ratings like Good Reads does for books. Then I can immediately just pick them out.,t3_jecslk

But different moods call for different genres. I may need to try it again to get out of the funk of the current world crisis. 
Random side note: I was watching an episode of Portlandia where they were doing a skit on binging Battle Star Galactica. So I was like, I want to watch a show that makes me not sleep and stay on the couch for weeks. So I thought I’d see what the hype was about. I literally watched the whole series in about 3 weeks including downloading it during vacation so I could watch it in the middle of the night and on the plane lol. The best series ever.

Frankly, if you check in with more episodes, or check out the subreddit.. the Orville is (sadly) the closest thing to a traditional StarTrek series (TNG, DS9, Voyager esque) that is on TV right now.  Its saving grace is that it grows on you, and it does the metaphorical intellectual commentary thing that I love about TNG too.  It can be a bit jarring that it is also a funny show.",t3_jecslk

I've since watched reviewers talk about Discovery season 2 and Picard, and I do not get the sense I am missing out on anything.  
 
  
&nbsp;  
Oh, and the cheating subplot takes a back seat at some point.  It isn't well done early on.  It is referenced occasionally in the dynamic between the two characters.

The basic plot can be summed up as: A couple who work in a circus steal a real mermaid from a guy and attempt to travel her across the seas to use her as  their main attraction. The woman (main character) begins to suspect she and the mermaid are somehow communicating with one another...blah blah...mermaid gets set free, turns out the mermaid isn't as innocent as she apepars.

It's REALLY good, although i do warn you that it is a horror movie. The memaid is very real looking, and has a unique design (or...i should say TWO unique designs but you will have to watch the film to see what I mean) that i think you dont see often. She's pretty, she doesn't speak, there are no talking animals or musical numbers.

Its a story of a deadly creature.  


2)  May i ask what are you expecting with a story about a mythical creature presumably oming on land an by default invoking the ""fish out of water"" trope which is a comedic trope?

Like the movie the mermaid chair. Its plot relates to a legend about a mermaid. It features a mermaid in the final scene. But it’s not a mermaid movie. 

Like Harry Potter. It’s not a movie about a three headed dog just because it’s in 2 scenes. 

The lighthouse may feature a mermaid as some sort of symbolic whatever as a motivation for the character but the plot of the movie is not centered around a mermaid. 

That’s why it’s not a mermaid movie. 

It’s a movie that has a mermaid in IT.

2886,gix5nb3,t1_gix429s,"> Like Harry Potter. It’s not a movie about a three headed dog just because it’s in 2 scenes. 

This is a terrible argument.

The three headed dog doesn't have a hold over the whole plot of Philosophers Stone, it's just in those few scenes.

The mermaid first comes up in one of the first scenes of The Lighthouse when Pattinson finds the mermaid totem and the symbolism and more prominent mermaid scenes carry a lot of subtle meaning.

It's obviously not as mermaid-centric as something like The Little Mermaid, but to say it's a film with a mermaid in one or two scenes misses the point a bit.",t3_kv667j

This is what OP is asking for.

> but to say it's a film with a mermaid in one or two scenes misses the point a bit.

I stand by what I said. I acknowledge the symbolism of what the mermaid may represent within the narrative. But it's just the same as ""The Mermaid Chair"" story, wherein the tale of the woman who turns into a mermaid means something to the plot. Despite it, it's not a narrative ABOUT a mermaid. It's a movie with a mermaid in one or two scenes. That is a fact. We are not following a mermaid swim under the sea. Its not about a mermaid turning into a human. Its not about a mermaid period.

It's about two guys in a lighthouse. The mermaid is an element of the plot. Like many other things.

Idk. Just saying. Lighthouse isn't one of the things that comes to mind when people ask for a mermaid movie. Just the same as a movie like aquaman (which only has traditional mermaids in in for a few scenes) is not despite it fitting the description way better.",t3_kv667j

3319,c9l32uk,t1_c9kw697,"I agree and would like to add:

Part of why this movie works is that it is VERY humanizing to the would-be terrorists. Yes, they are idiots (""We bomb the mosque!!"") but they are shown to have families, jobs, hobbies, etc...

Also of note is that one of the character's brother is a very devout Muslim and is a very peaceful and normal person.

An american parallel would be youths from a middle class or affluent neighborhood trying to be full out ""gangsta's"" 

Finally: The ""white"" Brits aren't exactly paragons of intelligence (Benedict Cumberbatch's character comes to mind)

In summation: If you can get past the similarities to recent events (and I can totally understand if that's an issue) this is a very smart and human comedy about a bunch of idiot wannabe's",t3_1cxiju

Every character in the film presents their own version of events that happened, and as Tonya is our protagonist we naturally want to empathize with her version (as you have clearly demonstrated). The irony is that the film itself is presenting this as its own version of ""the truth"" 

I'm too young to have lived through the actual Olympics when the movie takes place (I'm just guessing you are too?) so I felt the same way about Tonya when I left the theater but its important to remember that films are always what someone is choosing to show you and its important to question why they chose what they did.",t3_82tguy

Now, obviously these scenes were written for the movie, but I didn't get the idea that we were supposed to question that aspect. I think the general antics of her private life are meant to be ambiguous yeah, maybe she was a bitch indeed, but I think the core of the case is meant to be pretty clear cut. Meaning, the bodyguard took action without her knowing.

Also considering they way he talks about films and the way he talks about this movie in perticular. In every interview he talks with so much passion which wouldn't happen if it was just an Oscar grab. He started writing about it in 2011 but dreamed of it much longer. You are ignoring the evidence in front of you, you have a conspiracy with no evidence just the agreement of other chuckle heads. The Oscars hardly ever give a win to a genre film. Look at the past winners, it basically doesn't happen. A monster film about a woman and swamp creature falling in love isn't exactly Oscar bait.

Jurassic Park and Twister really suffered abuses out of all of them, they're the only two VHS that broke due to repeated use. :') I bought them again on DVD later cause I still love watching them. Twister is also one of those rare movies that I don't mind watching in French or English because the French dub and jokes are equally good to the English original version.",t3_kz3hp6

Interestingly I rewatched the first one not so long ago and at about the half-time I realized that It was far less funny than I remembered (even adjusted for not being a child anymore). Than I rewatched it with the german dub (how I originally watched it) and it was suddenly so much better. Usually I watch especially comedy like South Park, King of the Hill etc. in the english original language, but for some reason 90s live-action comedies are far funnier with their german dubs imo.

Thinking about that, I also really liked the Beavis & Butthead movie, which I discovered by accident because someone mixed up the VHS tapes at the movie rental store (should've been [""Bio-Dome""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115683/), so nothing was lost).

Anastasia. I argue it still holds up (as long as you ignore the historical aspect and pretend it’s a fantasy). Love the banter between Anya and Dimitri.

Blair Witch Project. I had a bunch of peripheral content for this movie. There was a fake documentary about Rustin Parr that I had on VHS. There was a YA book series about Heather’s cousin investigating her disappearance. This was before my family had internet so I’d go to the library computers to read through the lore on the website. I think this was also around the time I got really into ghost lore, like researching different types of apparitions (like orbs) and watching live security camera feeds for haunted buildings.

Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil is by far one of the best horror comedies out there and has plenty of gorelarity. I know that has been mentioned a lot but it is also available on netflix and hulu and shudder. Also don't let the horror part ward you off if you aren't into that, I wouldn't necessarily say it is scary but it is certainly in the comedy horror genre.

Murder party has also been mentioned and it is mostly a one room dialogue movie, but the dialogue is hilarious and once the gore starts, it doesn't stop until the end. 

Also as many others have stated, Quentin Tarantino is a master of gorelarious scenes and witty dialogue. 


I'm racking my brain for more now, I'll add an edit if I can think of anymore.

He receives instant success for advertisement without any of the frivolous additions (""Extra Vitamin D no shit"") but the power of the position gets to his head and everything comes crashing down (or does it).

Not for nothing is it set in the corridors and streets of the nation's capital - helpfully portrayed by the Coens' home base of New York City. *Burn* is a story of America loosing its purpose and struggling to remain relevant in a world that views most of its actions as meaningless or actively destructive.",t3_9yqgro

If you look at the title He Never Died they have a limited to 12 titles for each movie on its page. 

Something that was strange with ""He Never Died"" was that it didnt hand any recommendations at all. 

I suspect that it was due to being a netflix only production and IMDB is owned by amazon. 

Here is the thing. 

If you rate the title to 10 you get a very long list of recommendations related to that title. If you rate it lower than 5 nothing will show up. 

Here is a list of movies that show up rating 10 at He never Died.

Definitely worth watching. I liked it more before I analysed it in-depth, which is exactly what the director would hate me for.",t3_47xzvn
4510,d0g6qeb,t1_d0g6d0i,yea he was really just trying to make the same film allover again shot by shot... did a pretty good job at it.,t3_47xzvn

4513,d0g9oi1,t1_d0g8g8i,i agree about the commentary. don't understand why some directors have the need to step out and explain what the movie should make you feel or think. however - for me at least - it was very unnerving to watch. with or without the commentary the suspense was intense. and i like that a lot in a movie.,t3_47xzvn
4514,d0gfcqh,t1_d0g8g8i,"I would've actually really liked it if they didn't get obnoxiously meta with it. It's still not too bad overall, just sad that it could've been much better. If a movie is gonna do some heavy-handed social commentary, it's much better when it's more like it is in movies like Falling Down with Michael Douglas or Cabin in the Woods. If you feel like you need to look directly into the audience to explain what you're trying to say, you probably didn't do a good job illustrating it in the rest of the film. 

I took a Horror Literature elective in high school and even though it was basically just my English teacher's opinions about the genre (he has written a couple pretty damn good horror novels though), one thing he said that really stuck with me is that good horror should never be didactic. It limits interpretation and undermines/cheapens the work as a whole. To its credit though, at least the meta stuff in Funny Games is nowhere near as obnoxious as it is in movies like God Bless America or the awful Human Centipede sequels.

[Nightwatch (1984)](http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt0087795/) The story of the unknown comic. I found this on beta when I was kid and it was the first time I saw boobs. 

I'm not a fan of the band but the Insane Clown Posse's movie [Big Money Hustlas]

Just as a warning about Rare Exports, there is some CGI in it but it's a bit ""budget"" so it looks kinda cheesy.  If, however, you can let that not bother you, you will have a lot of fun with the movie.  There is also some old man nudity...

Both Rare Exports and Troll Hunter are out on DVD and Blu Ray now (if you are in North America), so they shouldn't be too difficult to find.  There are torrents of them if you do that sort of thing.

4968,dfkktsm,t3_624gp9,"A comedy-drama about a 16 year old boy who is suicidal and has himself committed to a hospital psychiatric ward where he must stay for at least 5 days.

The movie's themes of depression as an illness and people's attitudes to it are well handled. 

Being that the narrator is a teenager, the film is definitely something that would be more enjoyable for a younger person.

Keir Gilchrist, Emma Roberts, and Zach Galifianakis are all good in their roles(although I thought Roberts was underused and her character could have been more fleshed out).

Knowing that the film is an adaptation of a book I feel that the book is almost certainly the better medium for the kind of story being told here but the movie didn't have any particular flaws that made it un-entertaining.

At the end of the day it suffers the same plight that I find to affect most movies in the ""comedy-drama"" genre. Being that they are neither one, nor the other(this film certainly leans more towards drama however) they are utterly forgettable.

Nonetheless it makes decent viewing.

5202,dmjphpb,t3_6xwtaj,"In my opinion, the film focuses on the hyper- exaggerated characterization of the lead actors. The director is a white, cis-male and the drastic situations were heavy-handed and awkwardly portrayed. Prostitution or hustling is often for survival for marginalized individuals, this movie simply glorifies that aspect for entertainment.",t3_6xwtaj

5212,fi683w8,t3_f6i8a2,"There is a fine line to walk making a enjoyable movie making fun of a bad film before becoming one of the shitty films it was making fun, velocipaster was one of them.

It ran the ""its supposed to be bad and cheap"" joke into the ground early on in the film and did nothing new to actually keep my attention afterwards. Plus even when your making one of these films if you fuck with the film cutting your making the film harder to watch as opposed to making fun if it.

(Ps) does any one get the feeling that there is more people watching these kinds of films(machete, officer down, kung fury) without actually seeing the movies they are parodying then people who actually understand the References. I'm a younger guy who just watched his chuck norse movie 3 weeks ago but have been watching these parody films forever, seeing if there is anybody who can relate.",t3_f6i8a2

5226,fi773wp,t1_fi683w8,"I mean I watch a LOT of film. Not just B movies. I see literally every movie that releases on opening weekend and review them and I have an appreciation for artistic films, blockbusters, and B movies alike for separate reasons. I thought Velocipastor was super funny and cheesy and overall enjoyable. It was clearly made to be that way but it was still enjoyable. I don’t think you have to see the original content to fully appreciate the movies but I do think your argument likewise fluctuates into modern cinema as a whole. Like watching remakes such as Black Christmas (2019). It was a pretty terrible movie as is, I’ll admit, but you don’t really understand how truly bad the remake was until you see the original from the 70s. Sometimes I think that ignorance, in this case, is bliss. Sometimes it’s just more fun to enjoy something for the feeling it gives you in that moment.",t3_f6i8a2

5233,fi8atu4,t1_fi773wp,"For the past 2 years I've been going out of my way to see alot of the older movies my favorite filmmakers draw inspiration from. Black Christmas being one of them, I have yet to see the new one. Was it really a black Christmas film or was it a completly different horror film that took its name.",t3_f6i8a2
5234,fi5rypk,t1_fi5pvee,If I’m ever in Washington I’m heading over and suggesting that movie. It would be so much funnier wasted.,t3_f6i8a2
5235,fi8bx1x,t1_fi8atu4,So it’s based on a similar premise and they do reprise some scenes but not in ways that make sense. In the old one it was just a crazy man with no motive which to me made it scarier and more intense (that voice scared the life out of me). The new one is basically frat against sorority and it’s very overtly political but in a way that’s not even remotely tasteful. It’s also got sci-fi fantasy elements that really don’t make any sense at all. It is an attempt at a remake but it should’ve stayed close to the original source material. I watched both in one night and was sorely disappointed in the way the newest film chose to go.,t3_f6i8a2

As someone who has always been a huge fan of the John Hughes era coming of age comedies, this movie kills me. While the humor isn't ""smart"" I guess, it's very funny and I honestly think it links multiple plot threads from other movies into one narrative surprisingly well.

A similar gimmick can be seen in ***A Cure for Wellness:*** Starts off innocently enough, progressively gets more oppressive and tense, before culminating in a sudden surge of what-the-bloody-hell. Despite the very justified critiques regarding the final twist itself, I still recommend this film for the kind of emotion you're looking for.

First movie I saw this month, and I almost forgot about it. It's really good, surprisingly funny, great cast, etc. But, I don't see myself coming back to watch it again, and I understand why people don't like it.   
8/10

**Ex Machina (2014)**  
This one was really good. Alex Garland's direction in this is really beautiful, and the screenplay is so intricately filled with philosophy and it still remains really enjoyable. It's incredibly thrilling all the way through, and the ending is very-well done.   
9/10

**Annihilation (2018)**  
Loved Ex Machina so much, I had to check out Garland's other work. While I still liked this one, it was much more different. It relied a lot on actual scares, which were normally done well, although both the screenplay and the performances weren't really great. Once again, the ending is handled very well. (It honestly still scares me.)  
8/10

**Hero (2002)**  
This is a straight-up an essential for anybody looking to go into film, it's storytelling is unique and it's topped all of the most beautiful movies of all time lists, and for good reason.  
9/10

**Baby Driver (2017)**  
This is just so universally enjoyable. It's a masterclass in editing, the music is awesome, the action is always fun, and the performances are really good. It's thrilling to the end and I'll definitely be watching it again soon.   
9/10

**Lost City of Z (2016)**  
Wow. James Gray is an excellent storyteller. He tells a very difficult story with this one, and maintains a pretty flowy pace throughout, only stopping to let you awe at the sights you see. It's truly an amazing watch, and it's not only left me thinking, but inspired me as well.  
9/10",t3_guc7xd
5528,fso4enx,t3_guc7xd,"**Knives Out**  
My first ""whodunit"" movie, and it did not disappoint all the praise I've read about it. Left me hungry for more of this type of movies, and I quickly added some to my watch-list.  
Not quite sure how the sequel will pan out though, I'm not too optimistic, but at the same time, I don't want to kill the chicken before the egg has been laid. (Is that a saying? It feels like it should be a saying.)  

**Equilibrium**  
I have a soft spot for dystopian sci-fi, and am unsure why it took me so long to see this.  
Sure, the fight-scenes are obviously heavily inspired by The Matrix while not quite capturing the same feeling, but they are still great.  
The storyline itself of feelings being suppressed to avoid conflict was great, and Christian Bale nailed this role as well as he did in American Psycho.  

**Color Out of Space**  
There's no denying that Nicolas Cage has been in quite a few... mediocre productions, so it was refreshing to see him in something I really enjoyed again. Sadly I'm not much of a bookworm, so I am always happy to see works like this in movie format. Great visuals and good performances.  

**Cloud Atlas** I absolutely love Wachowski's *The Matrix* and *V for Vendetta*, and after having gone on a recent watching-spree of their other works, this was one I assumed I wouldn't like that much, but it grabbed my attention pretty quickly. Though quite long, all the different time periods and characters keep it refreshing for the whole duration. It's set in the past, present and future - and has every aspect of life; comedy, drama and tragedy.  

**Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn** I've seen many people shitting on this movie, without giving much reason for it. I enjoyed it very much (which for movies, usually have to do with having the right expectations and attitude when watching something). It's a non-serious, funny happy-go-lucky female psycho having fun, and I had fun watching it.  

**Horns** Daniel Radcliffe is far from a one-trick-pony, and it was about time I watched something of him not donning a wizard outfit. This movie was a great whodunit with a unique twist on how to carry it out.  

**A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood** I didn't have the pleasure of watching Mr. Rogers growing up, so have only watched some clips here and there after I had grown up. We could all grow so much if we took a few lessons from this man, and who better to play a wholesome and gentle man, than Tom Hanks.  

**Maleficent** Angelina Jolie has been a favorite of mine ever since I watched Hackers eons ago, and this was a great take on the ""other side of the story"" of a widely known fairy-tale. The sequel was also enjoyable, but didn't quite capture the magic of the first one.  

**Gattaca** Finally got around to watching this one. Andrew Niccol has been one of my favorite writers/directors for a long time, so once again I'm unsure why I put this off until now. To be honest, it's a bit drier and slower than what I usually prefer, but some days taking in a movie slowly is just what I need.  

**Us** I've never been much of a horror fan, but do try and watch movies/genres I think I'd dislike every now and then. This one in particular has at times been mentioned ad nauseam on this subreddit, so it was almost obvious to give it a go. I remember watching Key and Peele's skits, which is probably why the movie caught me a bit off guard, but I still loved it. Can't wait to watch *Get Out* as well.  

**Snowpiercer** Another one frequently mentioned, and with good reason. Class segregation with fast-paced action.  

**Guns Akimbo** Another one starring Daniel Radcliffe, this one I remember was talked about a bit on reddit when some photos of the movie with him surfaced here, wearing jammies and fuzzy slippers, wielding akimbo guns. It doesn't take itself serious at all, like Shoot 'Em Up, and has colors and camera movements that reminded me heavily of *Upgrade*.  

**Clue** The third and final whodunit I watched this past month. Who knew a murder mystery movie could be so funny and charming?  

**Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri** Watched it mainly because Martin McDonagh had written it. The same writer that did *Seven Psychopaths* and *In Bruges*, two movies I really enjoyed - and the former one also starring Sam Rockwell, whom I find quite amusing and charming. Though this movie strayed far from my expectations, I still enjoyed it very much. Woody Harrelson's performance also reminded me I need to add *Rampart* to my watch-list, as it has been on and off my mind ever since the infamous AMA on reddit many years ago.",t3_guc7xd

**Alien (1979)**

**Chinatown (1974)**

**North by Northwest (1959)**

I've only recently started getting into movies beyond modern blockbusters, so it was my first time viewing these iconic films.  All 4 lived up to the hype!

**Uncut Gems (2019)**

A great follow-up to Good Time, with nonstop intensity and another sleazy protagonist making increasingly poor choices. Excellent performances from Sandler and the supporting cast.

**House (1977)**

Japanese horror film with some of the most bizarre editing I've ever seen. Not really frightening but incredibly fun to watch. 

**The Ox-Bow Incident (1942)**

Henry Fonda-starring western with themes of mob mentality and vigilante justice. Lots of memorable characters despite a short runtime. This was recommended as an under-the-radar film by a /r/movies user who ranked every best picture nominee and I definitely agree.

**A Serious Man (2009)**

I love every Coen Brothers movie that I've seen so far and this was another winner. An introspective drama with the expected dark comedy. Less plot-driven and more of a character study but still quite engaging.",t3_guc7xd

&#x200B;

Shoplifters - is an infectious Japanese film about a family living on the poverty-line who resort to unconventional means to keep a roof over their heads. Didnt like the ending, but the journey to it was well worth the time invested.

&#x200B;

Burning - Korean suspense that is probably one of the best things I have seen so far this year. A must see example of contemporary Korean filmmaking.

&#x200B;

The Guilty - Danish film set in a single room and narrated almost entirely by a series of phone conversations. Surprisingly despite this, is captivating and moving. Must-see. (Scheduled for American remake with Jake Gyllenhaal.) See the original first so you can be cooler than your friends 

&#x200B;

Free Solo - ""Imagine you are competing in the olympics for a gold medal, but if you do not get the gold medal, you die"" (quoted from memory from the film, which is a documentary about free soloing, or, climbing huge mountains, alone, with no ropes, just because no one else has, and you think you could.

&#x200B;

Special mention for worst film - Glass -  As someone who enjoyed Split, I felt let down by this. Not really much of a psychological thriller, the action was uninspired, insipid as a super-hero flick. I just didnt take to the so-called clever narrative meta shit and feel like James McEvoy's talents were woefully underutilised. Didnt get near the bar of the first film IMO. Disappointing.",t3_bax1mi

- Alita: Battle Angel. Like any Rodriguez film, I can’t say I left the theater bored. Great action and world building, though the romance subplot left a lot to be desired. 6.5-10

- Bronson. One of Hardy’s best performances. Surreal in the sort of way Refn can excel at. 8.5/10

- Tarzan. Rewatched it for the first time since I was a kid. Great songs, great animation, plot is a bit basic. 6/10. 

- Hercules (2014). It was okay. I was entertained, but I’ve mostly forgotten it. 4.5/10

- How to Train Your Dragon 3. I love this series to pieces. The ending felt like a lot of fan fare, but I think it mostly worked to end a great series. 8/10

- Unforgiven. Certified classic. Great western send off for Clint. 9/10

- Gladiator.  “Are you not entertained.” Oh yes, yes I was. 8.5/10

- From Dusk Till Dawn. My girlfriend’s reaction was almost as good as the movie. Once again, a lot of fun from Rodriguez. 8.5/10

- Bad Times at the El Royale. Clever, great characters, fantastic soundtrack. My favorite film from last year. 9.5/10

- Monster Party. Cool moments, but ultimately lackluster. 3.5/10

- Jeepers Creepers. Still a great slow burn slasher/creature horror film. 8.5/10

- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. Best animated movie I’ve seen since kubo. 9.5/10

- Us. Felt like a Twilight Zone episode, but in the best sort of way. Good cast of characters, good tension building. 7.5/10

- Evil Dead II. Classic splatter film. 9/10

- Captain Marvel. Much better than I expected. Brie Larson was great and funny, Samuel L Jackson was also great as always. The plot was a pretty typical one, but worth a watch. 6.5/10

- Reservoir Dogs. Still my favorite Tarantino movie. Perfectly paced and acted. 10/10

- Asylum Blackout. Blood thriller/horror. Has a nice French extremity feel to it. 7.5/10

- Dragged Across Concrete. I’m convinced Zahler can do no wrong. 10/10. So far best movie of the year.",t3_bax1mi

Open your Eyes feels  a bit more gritty  and sinister than Vanilla Sky due to its lower budget and also due to being shot and set in Spain during the 90s.

In my opinion all of the characters in Open your Eyes also felt kind of different as they were more coldhearted and felt less fleshed out and less sympathetic than their ""Americanized"" counterparts.

[Summer in the Cage (83 min)]
(http://m.youtube.com/watch?list=TL_VYnJSPP9fc&v=ZANTo_czzPE)



This is the real life version of Silver Linings Playbook. It is an utterly harrowing documentary where the filmmaker, who had originally intended to make a documentary about pick-up basket ball, has his filming disrupted so turns his camera on one of the players instead. It traces the trajectory of a confident athletic young man, who becomes more and more maniac, passing into full blown bi-polar 1 and then charts the resultant train wreck / depression. Sad to see a talented person's life disintegrate before your eyes. 

The movie also raises disturbing questions as to the nature of the relationship between a Fim maker and his subject and to what extent mentally ill people can give consent. At the beginning of the project our protagonist might have felt a documentary about his life was exciting but I doubt he felt that once the depression set in.

The well paid new-age healer who she visits towards the end rang true and reminded me of my own plunge into endless exhaustive (and expensive) 'treatments' when the wheels came off my own life shortly after this movie was made.

I am not sure what  her psychiatric diagnosis would be, a feeling of despair underlies the entire movie. This film raises questions about how much of what is now labeled mental illness may in fact have an organic cause. *Helicobacter* and stomach ulcers come to mind - years of ineffectual psychotherapy rendered obsolete by a correct diagnosis and a short course of antibiotics.

>___Angels of the Universe___ (Icelandic: ___Englar alheimsins___ ( pronunciation (help·info))) is a 2000 Icelandic film and directed by [Friðrik Þór Friðriksson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fri%C3%B0rik_%C3%9E%C3%B3r_Fri%C3%B0riksson). The leading role is played by [Ingvar E. Sigurðsson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingvar_E._Sigur%C3%B0sson), who was nominated for the [European Film Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Film_Awards) for best acting. The story is based on [Einar Már Guðmundsson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einar_M%C3%A1r_Gu%C3%B0mundsson)'s novel of the same name, a semi-fictional story about Einar's brother Pálmi Örn Guðmundsson (named Páll in the book and movie). Much of the book is true, for example that Pálmi was [mentally ill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentally_ill) and painted as a hobby.

He sold the rights to try and make some money, same goes for True Romance- another screenplay he wrote, I believe also ‘94, too, &another great flick- Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Robert Duvall. If you guys haven’t seen it check it out.

Hot Shots - One of the best parody films ever made.  Period.

Airplane - An absolute classic.

Coming to America - One of my favorite Eddie Murphy movies.  Still holds up well even to this day.  Sexual Chocolate!!!

Clue - So much fun and such an awesome cast.  Great physical comedy.

Dumb and Dumber - Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as idiotic best friends on a road trip.  Need I say more?

Ghostbusters (the original) - Hilarious and zany with a killer cast as well.

Monty Python’s The Holy Grail - Bizarre yet hilarious British comedy with some of the best British comedians of all-time.  Must see if you haven’t.

Now all these movies are 80’s and 90’s flicks, but they have not only aged well but have enough “raunchiness” and adult humor to keep everyone laughing, but never going over to the point where you feel like you should stop the movie or skip a scene.

The absolute best bad-it's-good movie is Fly Boy. Not Flyboys with Franco, but Fly Boy. It's hands the down the worst movie I've ever seen, but also the best. Also incredibly rare. In fact, I'd be surprised if you could find it anywhere.

All of the 3 Ninjas movies are horrific. 
Anything with JCVD(Knock-off is a personal favorite, Blood Sport is just as good, also check out Sudden Death.)
The old Judge Dredd with Sly Stallone is awesome. Great puns and insane cheesiness.
Battlefield Earth is so absolutely horrible and is absolutely hilarious considering how seriously Captain Scientology John Travolta takes himself in the movie.
Let's see, what am I missing...
There's Extreme Ops, Soldier, Escape from LA, Tango and Cash...

I have a bunch more. These might be a little bit different from what you're looking for now that I realize it. Mine are a little more towards the cheesy end of things. I like movies with horrible and over-the-top dialogue. These definitely fit the bill.

I would contrast it to Birdman, which I felt was quite similar in being a surrealist film, but was a lot of fun to watch, a cinematic roller coaster to enjoy. Synechdoche just trudges a long, you're just hoping that the movie will be over at any second and it just goes on for another hour. It's just scene after scene of some witty comment the director/writer wants to say with no connection at all. We get what's going on, the main character is going to waste his entire life and die because he's so perfectionist.

As for mainstream hollywood movies that spell things out for a stupid audience, it's a different movie for a different purpose, but I do agree. There's *so* much sexism in hollywood it's insane. Almost every TV show or movie, the female character is a bitch or stupid and either impedes the male character or comes around because of the superior male. 

Take Sopranos, the wife is a bitch. I didn't write sopranos, it is what it is, women suck according to hollywood. Tons of typical women in hollywood, any movie where the wife abandons the husband instead of simply asking them 'yo whats going on?' like any real-world woman would do.

**The Tale**

A movie about sexual abuse and the way our memories adapt to make ourselves deal with trauma better. The story is told through present day and flashbacks as well as an interesting blend of fourth wall-breaking interviews with the fictional characters. It's directed and written by Jennifer Fox, who went through the same situation. She usually makes documentaries so the style that the movie is done in is kind of unique. Overall it was great and emotional and such an important and honest story. 

**Margaret** 

Anna Paquin witnesses a bus accident that kills someone. The rest of the movie is about the aftermath of that. It's about 3 hours but doesn't feel like a slog to get through. Paquin's performance is arguably her best to date. You go through moments of hating her but also understanding her. The characterisation is really good. It's very immersive. 

**The Talented Mr Ripley**

Yeah i finally got my shit together and watched this. I knew I'd like it ever since i first heard of it as a kid, but weirdly i never got around to watching it. It's taken me like 12 years! I think it holds up as a great thriller, even though i knew the plot vaguely. Matt Damon is great in the titular role, he really nails that creepy sinister genius vibe lol.

6261,fx8age1,t3_hmorxt,"**Mid90s (2018)**

It’s a realistic portrayal of both the mid 90s and skateboarding culture which is so cool! It shows you the truth of growing up in the 90s both good and bad and allows the viewer to make their own judgement. It’s got raw, organic performances from all the actors (most of whom are real skateboarders acting for the first time). Also it’s directed by Jonah Hill and loosely loosely based on his experience growing up skateboarding.

**Moonrise Kingdom (2012)**

A Wes Anderson movie that I somehow didn’t get to know about until recently. As always, very visually pleasing and it’s got that quirky Wes Anderson style comedy. It’s humorous in that the adults all act childish and the children act like adults. The story is really lovely, the actors, especially the children, all give amazing performances. A nice Sunday night movie I feel.

**Babyteeth (2019)**

This one feels almost like a coming of age movie but not exactly. It’s set in Australia and shows a developing relationship between a high school girl with cancer and a “junkie”/small time drug dealer. Visually it’s pretty stunning, with bright vivid colors. I felt like the style of the movie is quite unique, like showing some bite sized snapshots of moments that happened in the lives of the characters. Also a big part of the movie is the really interesting and believable portrayal of how humans (the parents and the guy) deal with the grief and fear that comes with someone they love having terminal cancer.

Some people might be turned off by the narration but it was well-written enough that it added more to the story than just exposition. Possibly my favorite of the month.

La Haine (1995)

Didn't know anything about the plot going into it and it turned out to be surprisingly relevant. An interesting take on police brutality and the cycle of violence, set in a poor neighborhood in France. Very natural acting/dialogue which is something I love in movies. 

The Player (1992) 

A great satirical take on Hollywood, particularly formulaic movies from major studios. Very much a movie for film buffs, with lots of references and cameos. Some of it went over my head but I still enjoyed and am looking forward to watching more Altman films.

Pride and Prejudice (2005)

Romance isn't usually my favorite genre, but I couldn't help but be charmed by this lovely movie. Keira Knightley gives an incredible performance.

Favorite scene: Too hard, probably the scene in which they walk among the Brontosaurus with the loud score in the background. The sheer scale that Spielberg presents in Jurassic Park is unmatched in cinema.

Mississippi Burning - A movie that is very much relevant to the world going around among us with police corruption by mindless pigs who can’t realize the South lost. A young Willem Dafoe leads the cast with his stoic screen presence as a young but lead detective in a case about missing protestors. Gene Hackman also brilliantly plays the #2 detective that falls in love with a young Frances McDormand who’s married to one of the leading policemen involved with the missing protestors.

This is an edge case question, but what about [films that are in the public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_in_the_public_domain_in_the_United_States)?  A few of the more famous examples are Night of the Living Dead, It's a Wonderful Life, and A Boy and His Dog.  

I totally understand a full ban for ease of moderation, but figured it was worth asking about.

Edit:  This got me curious and I found a website with literally hundreds of public domain films.  If it were simply a list, I'd link it.

There's so much camp in this film you can't help but enjoy the ride. Each actor is having too much fun playing the roles of historic filmmakers dealing with an actual vampire. The special effects are wisely kept in check with the setting, the vampire looks like Nosferatu when it was filmed. There's a bit of tonal oddity which hampers the pacing of the film, as it oscillates between horror, comedy, drama and back again.

Wilding had potential but meh: 6/10

Wilding is a Puberty Monster subgenre of horror and Bel Bowley as the protagonist elevates this movie to mediocrity. While she does innocence very well, I felt like the second half of the movie lost a lot of its charm. Shaky cam felt more like a way to hide the cheap parts of the movie, including when they go without practical effects for the monsters. Liv Tyler attempting to play a police officer with such a breathy voice didn't do it for me; she sounded more 'come hither' than 'comply'. Overall, Bowley does an amazing performance but her shoulders aren't big enough to carry this movie outside of middle-of-the-road.",t3_9lny08

I watched this documentary on Netflix last night. It really spoke to me.

[Kumare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Eyjeimdeg4)

It basically talks about how everyone is the same. No one is better than anyone, and any ""prophet"" is actually a fraud. All through the film and before the big reveal at the ending (not really a spoiler at all), he actually explains to everyone he is not a real Guru and that everyone should find inspiration (the guru) within themselves. He literally spends the entire documentary telling these people that he is a fraud, that they should find their own inspiration to be better people.

Really great film. Really touching. Really funny.

*-I made that comment on a more serious thread, but besides the really touching message, and emotional parts, it's a pretty hysterical film.

6441,cfkkw33,t1_cfkjwgx,"In my opinion, it's useful as an unscientific case study making a point about the non-dangers of marijuana use. He does consult with some medical professionals, who do not necessarily endorse his plan -- (paraphrasing) ""If I put on my private citizen hat, do I think marijuana should be legal? Yes. If I put on my medical professional hat, am I going to recommend that you ingest a crudely burned plant? I don't know the levels of what active chemicals are in there, I don't know the proper doosage, if it's good shit, bad shit [sic], *I just have no way of knowing*.""

Of course, it's mostly fun, and funny. It's part documentary about the dangers and non-dangers of marijuana use, part footage of a pothead comedian getting high and saying/doing funny things (it indeed splices a number of clips from his standup, since he's doing the ""experiment"" when on tour), part legalization advocacy. It's been a while, but I seem to recall some infographic-ey times that seemed to more-or-less fit the facts.

I don't see him making pot use ""look bad"", necessarily -- he's making it look harmless, I think, to those who might feel it's acutely dangerous. The big thing is that his month of sobriety isn't bad - no withdrawal, no robbing old ladies for dope-money - but his month of smoking is just *better*. That, I feel, is the thesis of the film -- pot just makes life a little all-around better.

In the end, I suppose it lacks the punch of a more important documentary since the people whose minds it would change would never see it, and those who would choose to watch it already agree with its premises.",t3_1yggx9

Lets take Vaughn, Sandler, obnoxious Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen (is that the same person?), this whole saturday nigh live group with one exception Will Ferrell. Will is great in sketches but he doesnt make good movies. He has like one good movie Everything Must Go, maybe Butabi Brothers some scenes with Chaka and nothing. From the rest you can make compilations one scene there one scene there but as a whole those movies sucks. Kevin James is unfunny (his show is fantastic, but he plays himself there-selfish, unsympathetic guy and it works in King Of Queens not in his movies), this fat loud cow Melissa Maccarthy (her sitcom is as low as it can be), those two from Sat Night Live are also unfunny, this new black hero Kevin Hart (he could be funny but he is too much like Martin Lawrence) is also a shadow at most of someone like Eddie Murphy.

He really grew on me by the end once they delved into why he acts the way he does, but he's definitely nowhere near as instantly lovable and adorable as Frost is when he plays the analogous role in the first two movies. 

I will say, from a purely comedy standpoint I do agree that World's End is the weakest of the trilogy. It's still a very good movie and high up on my list of favorite movies, but it didn't make me laugh as much. The saving grace in that department was how well they committed to the surrealism and absurdity of the premise.

But Naked Gun, slap stick gag comedy, has held up bc there are some many jokes hidden you don’t catch. Also as an alternative to a comedy movie check out stand up specials on Netflix. I found those to be the best bridge between needing a laugh and something new. Plus it’s only 30-40 mins. You’ll know right away if it’s your type of comedy.",t3_m74aaz

It was brutal and very media critical, which I'm not sure if you want to watch that if you want to get re-inspired in the filmmaking career.

Visitor Q weirded me out within the first 5 minutes. If you're not familiar with Takashi Miike, you need to be in the right mood for his schlockiness. His most accessible film is 13 Assassins, which is an ultra graphic movie about 13 Samurai deciding to kill this one guy who wronged them. The assassination takes about 45 minutes and does not shy from violence. If that sounds more your speed go with it, otherwise I thought everything else I've seen of his to be interesting if terrifying.

Dogtooth started really slowly so I turned it off and deleted it.

I'm a huge fan of Park Chan-Wook and that still did not save I'm a Cyborg and That's OK. Really weird, turned it off after 10 minutes. It's like someone told him to lighten up for once or they'll kill his family, so he took acid and made that movie.

The film can be irritating, but *Amelie* (Jeunet) was known for what you're searching for when he came out.

It's not a film, but the animated serie *The Last Airbender* was a big anxiety remedy. The characters are so awesome and doing their best, you don't want to leave them nor their universe (be warned, though, the first half of first season still obey a lot to children-show conventions).",t3_i1futu

Other picks - 

• Logan Lucky: for pure distraction. This is one of my favorite heist films. 

• It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World: I laughed so hard I almost suffocated. 

• Star Wars: The Last Jedi: I know, controversial pick, but I love this movie’s approach to its themes because it’s essentially about the overwhelming fear of failure and when you get right down to it, isn’t that exactly what anxiety is? So in this film, a ton of things go wrong for everyone but ultimately it’s ok because the film’s entire thesis is that it’s ok to mess up and it’s ok to be imperfect.",t3_i1futu

You do see people adding garbage text to hit the character limit after they've said all they feel they need to say, so maybe a reduction would be reasonable. Personally, I struggle to say anything in less than 100 characters, but that may be a ""me"" problem.

Overall neutral on it.

I see the OK cuck as an ad hominem, which makes the poster a Bad Actor and I'd normally toss, yet the previous Town Hall people said to warn instead. That's what I did.

7433,gtit4fm,t3_mkoquq,"A lot of Sundance/independent films tend to fly under the radar unless they get nominated for an Oscar or some big award or a major distributor. A lot do get overshadowed by other big releases in the same genre. my example of this is in 2016, 2 of my favorite movies came out and they were both musicals. On the one hand, I absolutely love **La La Land** but I do wish more people saw **Sing Street**. One of my favorite dramatic films, **Me and Earl and The Dying** Girl got released in 2015 but it was overshadowed by the multitude of sequels that came out, **Star Wars: The Force Awakens**, **Avengers: Age of Ultron**, **Jurassic World**, and **Furious 7** ruled the cinematic news scene. I get it, independent film is independent for a reason and you won't find it if you aren't searching for it but I just wish more people knew about them.",t3_mkoquq

+ The Drop (2014)
+ Machinist (2004)
+ Carnival of Souls (1962)
+ Mr. Nobody (2009)
+ Fifth Element (1997)

I know Fifth Element is an odd pick given it garnered a ton of attention when it was released, I just don't feel like I hear anyone talk about it in discussions on sci-fi films. Maybe I'm biased because it was a childhood favorite, but last time I saw it, it held up. 

The rest are all conventional picks that didn't get much return when they were released.",t3_mkoquq

I think there are tons of people who do look at that way that MASSIVELY benefit from discussions like this. Imagine the gems they might find having barely explored before 2000?

I do started to get a bit biased against movies when we're talking pre-60s, but I think that's just down to my taste in directing techniques/aesthetics/genres. Obviously, some directors just transcend their time period even from those eras I am biased against like Hitchcock. I am off and on doing a project to watch more of them though.",t3_mkoquq

7611,dhcpuov,t3_6a98jt,"There are lots of good ones, some you may or may not realize as being based on Shakespeare's plays.

10 Things I Hate About You - based on Taming of the Shrew, funny, heartfelt, early interesting work for Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Julia Stiles

Titus - starring Anthony Hopkins, it's a highly stylized, stunning send up of the bloodiest Shakespeare play, Titus Andronicus

West Side Story - based on Romeo and Juliet, set in New York, it's good fun and still hangs on the central romance, who could say no to dancing gangs and singing your feelings

Those are the top ones I can think of off hand as being more involved re-interpretations of the source material. Ultimately if you find you're having trouble getting into Shakespeare a movie might not be the way to go to really dig in, his works merit revisiting time and again and the language can take much more active listening than usual to parse particularly on a first go-round. Reading the plays themselves, ideally with annotations to provide historical or cultural context, can be the best place to start, then the dimensions added by different directors and actors come in to much sharper focus as they are making decisions about the text. 

A further non-movie recommendation would be the TV series Slings and Arrows, Canadian made, funny and pretty short, each season focuses on a Shakespeare focused theatre company putting on a specific Shakespeare play, you don't see the entirety of any of the plays they do, but you see meaningful scenes and they describe the layers of artistry and literary value established through set, tone, relative interpersonal relationships, and what it means to bring those characters and those stories to life in a worthwhile way.",t3_6a98jt

7613,dhcpbc0,t3_6a98jt,"The most obvious, and a personal favorite, is Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio.

Shakespeare in Love is also well done, but it's more about him as a person.

",t3_6a98jt
7614,dhe7lzo,t3_6a98jt,"**Here's the Shakespeare I've seen in order from best to worst:**

* Throne of Blood (1957) - Kurosawa's brilliant adaptation of MacBeth and one of my all time favorite movies
* Prospero's Books (1998) - I'm a huge fan of Greenaway's visually stunning adaptation of The Tempest with Gielgud in the lead (well, voicing all the parts actually). The music and imagery is jaw dropping. Probably too weird for a lot of people though.
* The Chimes at Midnight (1966) - Brilliant film amalgamation from Orson Welles - one of the few American actors that can do Shakespeare. It’s pretty hardcore Shakespeare though.
* Hamlet (1996) - Branagh pulls out all stops in attempting to claim the ""world's greatest Shakespearean actor"" trophy from Olivier. This is epic Shakespeare.
* Ran (1985) - Another Kurosawa masterpiece - adaptation of King Lear
* Henry V (1944) - I absolutely love the conceptual approach Olivier took with this adaptation. It's brilliant.
* MacBeth (1948) - Even on a low budget, Orson Welles can make movie magic and pull off some great Shakespeare
* Hamlet (1948) - Moody black and white Shakespeare with great atmosphere and one of the great Shakespearean actors in Olivier. Can't go wrong with this.
* A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) - This is visual splendor unlike any 1930s film. The screen simply shimmers with light and the acting from non-Shakespearean stars like James Cagney, Joe E Brown, and Mickey Rooney is surprisingly excellent.
* Henry V (1989) - Branagh is terrific in his first Shakespeare film. It's like he was born to replace Olivier in the Shakespeare cannon.
* Othello (1952) - Orson Welles again, and a terrific film.
* Richard III (1955) - Olivier is amazing at doing a whole film where he just talks to the camera, and it works beautifully.
* Romeo and Juliet (1968) - One of the classic interpretations of Shakespeare from Zeffirelli and pretty great. High school kids love it because of its fleeting nudity.
* MacBeth (1971) - It's been a while since I've seen this, and I remember it as a very bloody and realistic movie marred by 1970s production values (fake blood?). I need to rewatch though.
* The Bad Sleep Well (1960) - Another great Kurosawa adaptation, although I found it a little tedious.
* Forbidden Planet (1956) - Adaptation of The Tempest and great early sci-fi movie.
* The Taming of the Shrew (1967) - Liz Taylor and Richard Burton are simply fantastic and the film is lively and colorful and very down to earth.
* Hamlet (1990) - Mel Gibson pulls off a decent Hamlet in this sturdy, realistic adaptation.
* Otello (1986) - Film of the opera version of Othello and I remember being impressed by it when it came out.
* Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1990) - This alternate telling of Hamlet is very funny.
* My Own Private Idaho (1991) - Great movie but only loosely based on Henry IV, Part 1.
* West Side Story (1961) - I'm not a huge fan of this adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, but I'm a minority.
* Julius Caesar (1953) - It's been a long time since I've seen this but I remember liking it and it's got a great cast. Brando as Brutus!
* Titus (1999) - Great when Anthony Hopkins is on the screen, artsy and pretentious when he's not.
* The Taming of the Shrew (1929) - Possibly one of the shortest Shakespeare adaptations of the sound era, but Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford make it work even though it's lean Shakespeare. They're just a delightful couple and they can act.
* Othello (1995) - Branagh in another Shakespeare role and you can't beat Fishburne as Othello, but it's a pretty safe movie.
* The Merchant of Venice (2004) - Radford's adaptation is a high school safe traditional version, but Pacino is great as Shylock.
* As You Like It (2006) - Branagh directed this pleasant but forgettable pastoral gender bending comedy. 
* Richard III (1995) - This movie has fans, but I'm not one of them. The period language mixed with a fictitious Third Reich-like setting just didn't work for me despite the great cast.
* A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) - The movie is filled with beautiful people, but only Kevin Kline gives a notable performance. The lovers are irritating, adapter Michael Hoffman's direction is boring and lackluster, and most of the movie takes place on what looks like a big Broadway set.
* MacBeth (2015) - Two hours of whispered dialogue and handheld closeups - a very monotonous and dull rendering of Shakespeare.
* Hamlet (1969) - This is a weird hippie Hamlet done on a really low budget. I saw it long ago and don't remember much more than Nicole Williamson is one eccentric dude.
* Hamlet (2000) - Awful modern retelling. The only good thing was Sam Shepard.
* Much Ado About Nothing (1993) - The Americans ruin this one, esp. Keanu Reeves. It's the reason I haven't seen any of Branagh's other comedy adaptations. I should probably check them out.

**As good as Shakespeare:**

The Lion in Winter (1968) - You could swear the Bard wrote this amazing play about Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Powerhouse acting, esp. Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn. If this were Shakespeare, it would be near the top of the list. Watch Beckett (1964) first to get the full story, even though it's not as good.

**And worth watching:**

Shakespeare in Love (1998) - Lots of people hate this movie, possibly only because it beat Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, and Life is Beautiful at the Oscars (a WWII three way split?) but it's a really cute and fun movie for people who like Shakespeare.

**And avoid this:**

BBC Shakespeare - in the 80s the BBC made TV adaptations of all the Shaksepeare plays, but they're generally pretty dull. It's the only way to see some Shakespeare plays on film though.

1. Real footage. If you can get through A Serbian Film, I don't know if any other film will get you to stop watching just from being graphic or gross. Unless it's real gore. I can't really recommend anything, because I have no interest in seeing films with actual extreme violence. Your best bet of finding that would probably be indie documentaries. 

2. A personal touch. Pedophilia, murder, rape, and torture in films hasn't gotten to you, so maybe you should try finding something you can relate to. Todd Solondz is the guy for me in that field.

To me, if you're going to suggest a Solondz film that is disturbing, check out the popular film [Happiness](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147612/?ref_=nm_knf_i1) (which many consider to be his masterpiece) or Storytelling (as you mentioned). I haven't seen [Life During Wartime](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808526/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_3), but I guess there's more on the subject of pedophilia there. Pedophilia and sexual abuse seem to be running themes in his films - with the exception of *Welcome to the Dollhouse* (unless you count the dark comedy/empty threat by Brendon Sexton's character in keeping with that theme), *Fear, Anxiety and Depression*, and [Dark Horse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1690455/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_2) (which I'd skip if you haven't seen it).

Lady Bird, features one of the actors from Billboards, Lucas Hedges. Another very touching film. 

Thor: Ragnarok, can't go wrong with a marvel movie.  

Dunkirk, it's Christopher Nolan, what else is there to say? Plus if you like Harry styles, he's in this and does great for his first acting gig. 

Get Out, a movie about the injustices minorities face every day, in the form of a horror film. Surprisingly well done seeing as this is the directors first full length film. 

IT, fuck just watch this please. 

Logan, a great film. Not just a good superhero movie. It's very well done and a great send off for hugh Jackman's wolverine.

I'm sure this idea has been thought of by actual filmmakers, but they probably realized the issue.  How do you market it?  If you market it as a light comedy, people will go in for that and come out mentally traumatized and ask for their money back.  Word would get out and it could be looked at as an undesirable movie.  However, that could also spur interest, so it would work both ways.  If you truly wanted to keep the surprise under wraps, you could only do so for the opening weekend.  

You're right that it would take just the right people and tone to pull it off.  You'd need to sell both parts, making the comedy or romance truly funny and involving (not a mask for what's coming), and then the horror truly dark, like the second half of *Martyrs* dark.  It couldn't be tongue in cheek or a comedy horror.  I like the idea of being put off balance.  Take a look at ""Unedited Footage of a Bear"" on YouTube if you're unfamiliar with it.  It's not the best example, but it approaches the idea.",t3_nkj20z

Love, Simon is very close to the others you suggested, and definitely a good film if still falling a bit on the conventional, paint-by-the-numbers teenage dramedy side of things.

I would suggest looking away from mainstream studio films and into indie films, as the dramedy genre thrives in that space, and these smaller movies tend to take more risks, be edgier and, quite frankly, often times flat out better than the mainstream stuff. 

Some suggestions, both mainstream and indie:

Ladybird

The Florida Project

Tangerine

Juno

Little Miss Sunshine

The Spectacular Now 

Noah Baumbach's entire filmography (Squid and the Whale for something more on the side of drama, Meyerowitz Stories and While We're Young for something more on the comedy side)

Like 70% of Woody Allen's career (At the very least Annie Hall and, for something more recent, Midnight in Paris)

Squid and the Whale definitely leans more on the drama side. Meyerowitz Story is also excellent but funnier and lighter, so perhaps start with that on Baumbach.

Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster is a great satire about the societal pressures of attaining relationships that goes into some dark places.

Terry Gilliam's Brazil is definitely satirical - a dystopian nightmare comedy about a man becoming obsessed with a woman he met in his dreams. It's pretty critical of bureaucracy and Hollywood's happy endings.

Orson Welles' F For Fake is like the perfect satire. It's a documentary about fakery and forgeries but in itself it's a false documentary, blending fact and fiction in such an innovative way (archival interview footage having conversations with each other; Orson Welles telling false stories embedded in reality; etc).",t3_ak18gl
